Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as the dest@@ abili@@ zing of Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington has critic@@ ised Israel &apos;s ongoing sett@@ ling construction , and def@@ ends Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deal struck by Obama in the Iran nuclear programme has worsen@@ ed the relationship between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an affair against Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech had not been discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call Professor , to have shot his girlfriend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told him that he had shot his girlfriend , and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead wife could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was stuck on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved A@@ my and she was the only woman who loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb who had travelled in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already killed 300 miles to the school area where he shot and killed a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ fen@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb made the disa@@ strous emergency call , sometime after that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting in the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what they motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the State , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some incl@@ ines to problematic behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons , saying that he had any health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , he only taught two online classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would represent no guarantee for an automated way to an employment as Assistant Professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are questions , the Lamb cannot answer any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he came back in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car still ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb began its work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in education in spring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her guitar playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , he was the black women &apos;s flock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously a couple of times together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a ba@@ it in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played together the one or the other gig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer - a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room - a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier said that he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were at the clearing , shou@@ ting together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and specialized on American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was president of his br@@ other@@ hood and the student committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community participated in a candle light memorial service on the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mrs. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ watch , while the University Choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Re@@ be@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans were contributing to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was corrected to reflect that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss described as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less labour for the Christmas season
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give up a chance to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centres throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that this month , it will start with job interviews and the number of employees from October to December is rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business moves closer and companies are preparing to hire employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael J. Fox is jo@@ king about his &quot; date , &quot; Princess Diana &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming movie &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated dr@@ um@@ ming and an arm &apos;s length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D DVD and in selected theaters in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s strengthening military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years lasting conflict and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban asked the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria which they proved in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously question what it means for the nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts stress that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising tide of Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise star@@ ving power and start to let their dollar flow in order to overthrow him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some current survey values , indicating that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s@@ ling@@ ots percentage points have turned 180 degrees , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten say , they have a negative opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and these figures are in early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week , that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; unhappy &quot; or &quot; disp@@ le@@ ased &quot; if any Bush , the favourite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Tr@@ ump temper@@ ament does not see a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number is in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think he has the personality for a supreme commander , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively conduct his mandate , and almost six out of 10 Independent claims that his temper@@ ament is not in the White House , says ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they expose their guar@@ dians , republi@@ can voters hold junk for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , four out of ten last week say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time of July , when four of ten of July put their money on Je@@ b Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time in the final cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will view a campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the scattered field probably contributes to b@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans said , they have formed their minds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half the voters who support Tr@@ ump , say they have firmly assigned their votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , much has happened to change that and no one can really say never to change the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to change to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the issue of immigration , with Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump has been cited in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape &quot; were the immigration and fishing spots in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are worried that the bom@@ b@@ astic behavior of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will be kept away from the Republi@@ can party , and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fru@@ stration over the government climbs on new levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son now accounts for around half the support of republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also angry at Washington , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with 54 % of &quot; unhappy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the Hob@@ look@@ en@@ weg , the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof @-@ house cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , in which special positions one square meter is most expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential locations , however , the price is just like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double tor@@ rent in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lucky hit by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern was pav@@ ing the way to a earned 3 : 0 at Olympia &apos;s Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sovereign kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze have given the FC Bayern into the &quot; Mission Milan , &quot; in the witch &apos;s chair of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Champions League in the Greek record champion Olympic champion in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth start success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller received his 28th consecutive awards in the Champions League for Bavarian leadership , awar@@ ding attention to Olympic champion Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion as a f@@ lange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ oud promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ held word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision , without shining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including famous clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went with courage , but often with their offensive endeav@@ ours they were often too in@@ ventive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k turned out of the right half @-@ field in the upper upper gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion delivered the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in half , Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , when Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Pol@@ es of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct delivery , the Tor@@ wart Roberto was par@@ ked with the knee ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Bav@@ arians were domin@@ ating their domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set up needle tat@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tor@@ tu@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was forgiven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Guardi@@ ola made a qu@@ ad with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero was given the green light after the final qualifying session , said Sport@@ director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9. ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of captured Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently provoked the supporters of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich pendant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good news : when ren@@ oun@@ cing , the risk decl@@ ines rapidly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.@@ 6 times higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists have observed more than 3,@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the relationship between smoking and tooth loss is due to more frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly inflamm@@ ations in smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained Er@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , study leader H@@ a Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels , and according to our findings , it also leads to good oral health to a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness was affected by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous research had already pointed out that smoking increased the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ates the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists come across from Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer to the remains of late Anti@@ quity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated , said Museum leader Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been looking for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always considered to be the subject of archaeological preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third construction phase of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it was already known that at the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century have stood a church , Trier explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman captured by freight train
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman is killed at the railway station in the Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police asks the population to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40@@ pm , the woman came from the direction of the station and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach towards Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by registering the train , she has carried severe injuries to the Federal Police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was treated in emergency by emergency , and was brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the reason of the ni@@ ghtly crossing of the young woman , the explan@@ atory function@@ aries have no findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses , or residents have heard acoustic noti@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local residents or pedestri@@ ans from Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Bri@@ ck@@ yard , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ street and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on the cause of the accident , may be provided around the clock , and provided free hot@@ line by the federal police under phone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for resol@@ ving the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way equ@@ als much more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system to trust citizens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the responsible EU commission@@ er Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposes to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by TTIP , the largest free trade zone in the world will be created with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , there is also a second instance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would allow it to rise against judgment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the parties involved agree with each other on refer@@ ees , and there was no objection to their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of recent months , it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in regards to fair@@ ness and justice failed to comment on Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , they want to work towards an international investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , demanded above all by major corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , allowing companies to gain compensation for tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or reduce consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ s discussed the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it was critici@@ zed that they are not supposed to apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Economy Secretary , Matthias Mak@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform , the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the opportunities of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on the TTIP free trade agreement ( TTIP ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the US so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today , Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the in@@ timi@@ dated folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells us about different places he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs tell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they originated and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ rer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can always drift into great opul@@ ent moments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an , &quot; would be the first part of a hidden series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and had a positive outlook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide celebrated masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts , and in no one @-@ year @-@ list the influential music media is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens will then be served on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth Annual studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but supported by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the smaller clubs long ago , the stage shows become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage decoration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the dark held Hamburger L@@ earn more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although nearly 2000 guests are now b@@ anded in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens become much more mature , back to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without judging a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience hears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can actually throw away the &quot; record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens humble himself only for an en@@ core , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally , and eventually bows to thunder@@ ous applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ut at the Prime Minister &apos;s stage
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s brief@@ ing with suspen@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s commission@@ er and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the vicinity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also said he could skip some meetings , to leave them to colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain stead@@ fast during a commem@@ oration ceremony for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has been provoked by a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several multi @-@ page stories in the newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and recognised the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of Shad@@ ows ministers refused to serve leader in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they appealed to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him as leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are st@@ acking within the Labour Party , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23.@@ 000 pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he has been CEO of T@@ ory , over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy approach , says he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s question is too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from tac@@ king himself and the right to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic Minister , is represented when he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally took the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the sub @-@ house , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kasper@@ l @-@ theater , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was first broadcast in television in 1990 , the questionnaire was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the Lower House and its position among its parliamentary colleagues , although critics have argued that it was a cartoon and needed extensive reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

pounds increased by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s target target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and experienced estim@@ ation of the time of an increase in interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set up his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports lending business reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate the higher labour costs for his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserved in half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even bi@@ valve itself does not .
this has taken care of anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for publicity in the super@@ sti@@ ce , he paid three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with every doll , which looks like he and about the counter , Bi@@ eber also cas@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 100 million , he is said to have been so exploited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some say , the hyp@@ e g@@ ush too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others emphasize , Bi@@ eber is finally in the USA and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at No. 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes rather than D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen accidentally on television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ew@@ er sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the idea has allowed the Lebanese to enter the patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ew@@ er contains , Al@@ hay does not want to betra@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among its customers , the culinary international understanding proceeds well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ cash starts ground resistance campaign to combat aging inv@@ a@@ sions
met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch off an Al@@ di @-@ invasion in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ a gro@@ cer has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia , ahead of a 700 million US invasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets will strengthen their relationship with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media and events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board with brands such as S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough that distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and sell shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more details of his defense strategy will be published on 29 September when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual Investor @-@ Strategy Day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cut about five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley , estimates that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million per year and met@@ cash 250 million dollars by the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that in the next year , Al@@ di has opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost met@@ cash around 13 million $ gain before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recently conducted pol@@ l by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley expects Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s to grow by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and to reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne to likely disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ a refused to react publicly , to comment by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ re recorded contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i@@ Gas Market Share declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , wholes@@ al@@ ers refuse and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to purchase prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week to improve their shops and deliver a better choice of private label food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an are going to grow and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios , and deserves praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour after the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka to the Montreal masters with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , and Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Cy@@ ril and I was supposed to beat the child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was finally seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp caught a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he broke a bat when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 year old , he works very hard , he has never had any problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take Kyr@@ gios at the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term permanent part into the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversy surrounding them , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Nick has quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary declared the state of emergency and ruled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all who tried to get illegal in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos followed the border , as hundreds of migrants gathered in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who escaped from violence , stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built up tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants &apos; open the border ! &quot; and scre@@ ams insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some had returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary were sent back , while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a collision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries must take place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a stringent meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were looking for refuge in the over @-@ coming months or by the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis , so they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison funds were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insisted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or damage the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence to build the government along the southern border to Serbia . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the state of emergency , &quot; said Ms Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament still needs to agree with the military deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penet@@ rated into the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of being offen@@ ded by the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , authorities are to repair the fence quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after having arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos caused the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to get there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 20 managed to get involved , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they arrive to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage hal@@ ved before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has now supported 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders grew by 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is chann@@ eling for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by which candidates they will support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is holding a big margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these le@@ aps have less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage over the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit promin@@ ence in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them , because they are the nomin@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they would not support six percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton , but only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say this about their top channel data Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the nomin@@ ee is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) followed by the view that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with problems and di@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half , that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s margin increases before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twenty @-@ five percent of democratic voters sees Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure sank by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at him as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about sel@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similarly as last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features in choosing the pre @-@ elections of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maj@@ orities see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty in the three candidates , whereas Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server as Foreign Minister , most Democratic voters are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is a different story in the American public , overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was deterior@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the constitu@@ ents of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do not hold 62 percent of voters for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters see nationwide even tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes in leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush work best with hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority looks more than honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two candidates now accounts for half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month at 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ son shot at the same time , from 6 % to 23 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well on demographic groups and passes tr@@ ump among republi@@ can voters , with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , except C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Repub@@ lic@@ ans in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son increases in the surveys - with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post revealed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign on I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at present , up to 29 degrees warm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a maximum of 17 degrees , a bath in the North or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people are no longer going to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic Sea , it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the br@@ other@@ hood bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student died during a deportation ritual in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder attacks were filed against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brussels attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during a single introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said that he had been charged with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to target a frozen field to a target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ br@@ other@@ hood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was impot@@ ent and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the br@@ other@@ hood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members of the party began to hide utensils and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood in principle about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ fen@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injuries to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the br@@ other@@ hood . at least one student dies since 1970 , &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder &apos;s third degree for the first five members .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ uch College &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has forbidden the Brotherhood and the national br@@ other@@ hood has rev@@ oked their membership to the local community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will happen , if the F@@ ed increases interest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a interest increase comes , and the house is forced to s@@ wer@@ ve , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take , and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance for the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest , and lasted for 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have strongly emphasized that investors should not focus when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , multiple variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , however , market participants could find that all the fuss was possibly exagger@@ ated because of a rate increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first rise in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock which many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a look at historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy might react : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that assets are stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after initial up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which may reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a newer study to what happened after interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more detail , the market in the past 35 years is usually about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , rather flat in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in previous six cycles of asset management at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the increase cycle , and the return begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point , when a rate increase of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 rate increases since 1950 only had twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and forecast for the third quarter according to Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; market participants have made an interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could have an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study all the enh@@ ancements cycles of 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest running the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fixed income was also volatile since the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on bonds , the returns seem to change the direction as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / lowering is carried out in the cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the growth cycle , the bond firms immediately drop , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to the yield between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cautious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is interesting is Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings curve is flat , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large and large companies , companies that un@@ wind the greater part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debts will be worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to react very positively , three months after an initial interest rate increase , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with high capital returns and low volati@@ lity of their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers could see gains due to higher yields , even though experts of different opinion are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Council Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conservative member critici@@ zed the channel for its &quot; du@@ um@@ ming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards and said that she only im@@ itated The Br@@ its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins responded to The Voice , saying that this is not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Classic FM &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says a leader in parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public broad@@ caster radio station &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; and increasingly can no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also focused on the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Director @-@ Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was lying far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the involvement of Radio 3 , finding new music and giving new works , I think it &apos;s really important , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller , Alan Dav@@ ey , argued that it was harder to get involved when it did this in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the choice of culture , media and sport under fire to hit the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins responded to The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; find a hit from our own stable &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from another series of The Voice in the future or to give money to revenue ah@@ ler for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internet sales increased in August at the slow@@ est , and the Black Friday may be responsible for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in the year 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that the Black Friday has slow@@ ed its output in November , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating , after new figures only showed 7 percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating , after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix to Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , this comm@@ utes itself and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America , is cited as a reason for decreasing turnover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times hit the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe Black Friday , where the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , buyers could stop shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium ( British Retail Con@@ sortium ) found that £ 5,000 were issued a little more than £ 1 online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the city cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims bury the in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial objects in Mec@@ ca by the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia lays down the breakdown , partially of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them that were killed as a crane collap@@ sed in Mek@@ kas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect as the first of the dead occurred their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ dest@@ al cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procession passed over to the Holy Site , where only days before a building crane went through the ceiling of the mosque and then fell onto the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King sent a san@@ ction to the construction company of Bin Laden because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 patients who were killed , as a crane collap@@ sed through the Great Central Mo@@ sch@@ ee Mek@@ kas , were carried through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , King Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arabic version of the decree issued by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man gel@@ ed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane to fall into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee where hundreds of thousands of Muslims stood before the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group because of not current security measures , and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ ch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project , which is managed by the Bin Laden Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bin Laden &apos;s family has been associated with Saudi Arabia &apos;s royal family for decades , and is taking over larger construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dead leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said , that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government representatives stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) was paid to the members of the killed and the same amount to permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other verb@@ s , half of this amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Boss says , that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at professional tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent for the Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes , put down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can handle a hammer or brush to walls walls , you apparently belong to a minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their homes , such as the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices has meanwhile out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops geared to craftsmen and to close up to 60 retail outlets of B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions are hit by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the men predomin@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must shift this towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK &apos;s FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also rev@@ amped its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that owns 50 percent of the teams with women , including its management and CF@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales , after the Group sh@@ ook off the costs for closing the shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob were responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and transfer education on Wednesday .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of office abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the state prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , preliminary examination revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the accused decided to use money from the accounts held in their functions for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it damages the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials are also charged with financial years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact was rejected by the Chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point there was a disadvantage for the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials only charged compensation and the sports club for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we were standing in front of the situation : will we continue or lock the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread @-@ based broad@@ caster of the financial institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have pur@@ posed money to lay down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during acceptance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed that you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the case of corresponding financial success , the payment of compensation claims has been eff@@ ected retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , as from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , flat and non @-@ detailed bookings also appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and accounts held together the two def@@ endants , said the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial lobby , it was important that only the freedom of the debt had been the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the bank account against the one functional investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were back@@ rests , the def@@ endants declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran to the name of the second accused , and according to his testimony was not known to the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the respon@@ dent knew no answer for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said , after all , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ def@@ endant was informed , the function@@ ary justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; damage indem@@ n@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first def@@ endants declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association was never damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what shall I do when the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never had a cent content , he merely reck@@ oned with mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Di@@ ets , he charged 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the early years , exact documents for the early years could not show the def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were after an audit in which everything had been considered correct , no longer been kept , they explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mil@@ eage was also the second def@@ endant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the exercises were made in cash , to which he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main hearing will continue on 23 September , with the survey of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the staff cuts running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will build more jobs when spl@@ itting the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the he@@ aders at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the scope of its restructuring , the US technology group plans the extraction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate clients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , costs amounting to 2.@@ 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special charge of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the stock exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the company from California Pal@@ o Alto has grown up in a new society - separated from the promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another dis@@ appointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate customers to his services , the second largest PC manufacturer ranked the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the revenues went back in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP responds with a spl@@ itting and massive breakdown of changes in the sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and get more and more business online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 5@@ 5,000 jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , overwhel@@ m the majority against rejection : 54 percent spoke against it by 35 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other countries are flying air@@ strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke T@@ rän@@ eng@@ as , the Hungarian police attacked several hundred displaced refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the violence erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it a police line had formed , and a water cann@@ on was standing behind the polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the officials stopped pe@@ pper@@ y spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children , who inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees collap@@ sed , and suffered under breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , the press spokesman for Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; time of decision on interest rates for the US staff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note joins two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reu@@ ters found that the F@@ ed would do so , and now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historic event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est put interest on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and initiate a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of power , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision is to be announced on Thursday , at 8 : 00 CE@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
death thro@@ es at Delta State University leave exc@@ uses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note in order to say that &quot; he could make it happen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of geography and social science education at the delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 am Monday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He was shot on someone and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb said the staff of the emergency center , that the police must send police to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller on his name , but he did not give him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing him on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss became Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said that she was married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by the Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 , from the Delta State University , Lamb received a doc@@ torate like his life @-@ law on the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor was also alleged to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this , certainly demands its tribute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the 150 executives around the world , Group restructuring will cost the workplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot union , there are meanwhile new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure , and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings &quot; cheap carto@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution of some EUR 500 million per year from cost and income syner@@ gies , divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the airline for passenger business in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new setup , Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airlines operated under the Air@@ line Group roof , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Neg@@ oti@@ ations with the Pilot
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dispute with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court stopped on this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shared the union with him .
the topic of the talks is to be the reti@@ re regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year with a projected record result , cockpit has to come as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , the concept is &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa re@@ stores lines to the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; Dawn in the South , &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger are seen in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish @-@ based Finn@@ in has compiled a selection of tit@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House , which encourage their viewers to embar@@ k on their journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , a double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this will cause the left outer def@@ enders to cry and exclude him for at least six months of playing , Louis Van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w entered the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field , and needed oxygen before being brought to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double bone frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later , and then operates in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic playing , and then it happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ ume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mexican . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al presum@@ ed , that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the European Championship in France , the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a broken leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball which was in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ eno said in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad about it , I &apos;m so sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to the hospital , after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely David Cameron , The Lor@@ ax knows better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it by heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read to my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , re@@ stores the content of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a young named T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , hopes to see the girl of his dreams , fulfilling her wish to see a real tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if this would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by Cameron is read partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is arti@@ ficially arranged and even the air is a commodity , a young named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , The Lor@@ ax has not read a child twenty times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s elec@@ tive circular office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finding Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you see the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a forward @-@ win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali has developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th leaves from the England test cad@@ re , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared towards results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination , since - and I said this before - players are their best sel@@ ections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he hopefully turns out further acquisitions for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss also praised his attitude , even if he did not offer such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton scored nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home , and forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England initially deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I &apos;m highly restric@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to beat mos@@ ques alongside Cook , creating an extra Sp@@ in bow@@ ler and getting four squ@@ e@@ cks appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty man has already shown that he is a devil @-@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ ques might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire County , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my previous team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he joined the opening in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made three hundred re@@ ins right away , and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited interaction with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t but there is no great number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ es , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the test games could be a master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and powerful commitment to the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in harmony with the previously said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ ky te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot obtained a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain from the EU ) could gain potential , if the economy is moving into a trap by 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day even without the choice of the brilliant Jerem@@ y . &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C that fi@@ erc@@ ely fought for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states are mired in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from its own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger the social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants to look out Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s pru@@ dent Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years , and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the exagger@@ ated long endurance rac@@ ers such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also a blin@@ ding force , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to imagine that they are going to tear themselves a leg to help prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy is better to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan useful comments on the SN@@ P style during the British referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankruptcy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press seb@@ ar@@ one , as it was not supported by a referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all his sensitivity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ gers , telephone h@@ ack@@ ers ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ Indians who have most of our big newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tony Bla@@ ir actually thought about them , but noted that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band acted as Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press never failed him , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly c@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time anymore for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe , I express it friendly - in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p traditional blu@@ ff@@ ar@@ b@@ ur tendency and the wild behavior of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n &quot; but not B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties according to all reports on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever the touch@@ ingly bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media - a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free card for Europe that allows him to support Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ encing campaign for granted as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents - for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of do@@ gmati@@ sm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities towards Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital , - they also have suspi@@ cious voters to make concessions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military service in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what was reminded by the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critici@@ ze Public Health England report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et , critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which substanti@@ ates its most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) in order to analyse their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also under@@ wrote the testim@@ oni@@ als of BA@@ T for Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants stated that the funds were obtained from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , the tobacco management of p@@ he participated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work is a sign that there is a shortage of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well Being at p@@ he , said he has already responded to the claims of BM@@ J before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by defining current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC for@@ giving E@@ ast@@ ers , says former leader of Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like E@@ ast@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to hold the radio charge , which I don &apos;t think medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least set up its production on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art time window , because they want to achieve the greatest possible support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , calendar is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson - an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC &apos;s fault in the hunt for reviews is &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture held in Edinburgh in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows should be selling like E@@ ast@@ enders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the more public @-@ legal NGOs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they carry out their tasks and they can argue if they are based on their apparent missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sk@@ id programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them into a time window , where no one ever wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radio charge , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are for the 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review its char@@ thi@@ an mission to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take a look at the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ stein , the BBC , said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms that he said that only a handful of TV will be shown to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows , how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound pulses , which have high frequencies for human ear to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , which can be used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said to the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thread worms don &apos;t usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures , called TR@@ P 4 ion channels and found in membranes of some of the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells that are assigned to them , such a report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using ultrasound on altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ oms and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ ons with impulses of light on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which are visible at bus stops and underground trains and require a second look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important announcement : from September 15th to 18th with the D@@ LR ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the D@@ LR @-@ line that turns into the picture of a tank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , a s@@ warm of weapons dealers with D@@ LR will drive ... customers are asked to help at the ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 300 posters are from artists , who exhibited their work at the Museum of cru@@ el@@ ty designs in Ban@@ sys disc@@ ard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; to claim that &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet is claimed . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and Professor at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists work with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters , greeting commuters in the Sub@@ way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who also works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which was around the publicity for the Ce@@ Ce@@ MAT - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic company advertising , but &quot; with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a progress of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not acted illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the tru@@ ce fair dates back to the area within Excel , where exhibitors get fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in dormit@@ ories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ er 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense s@@ miles of those I have been anno@@ yed - and the numerous , long @-@ lasting complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance to the student residence ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely frigh@@ tening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to scre@@ am : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ches and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often turn into beverage recipes , film night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people get dressed and put their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related to this , do not remember to begin with a relationship at the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intro@@ ver@@ ted , a rough treatment is obtained at the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ room B@@ um@@ mel culture that is friendly and socially and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone , who tries to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away to get the energy back I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality , and send him an SMS instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apro@@ pos swa@@ ying : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include through baking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the university at the height of back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people to imagine a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain , and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; badly missing l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping dor@@ man@@ t when you drop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a ste@@ aling , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check this with the dairy owner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chances are good that they say they are serving themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion -- but try to deal with it more balanced than my room@@ mate who added to her milk a pur@@ ge to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if it was a bit qui@@ eter for them , for it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they responded with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would come to the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , it would not be fundamentally embarrass@@ ing if you keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , turn to them and see them every day and perhaps see how they move together all together friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to give your under@@ belly a little reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good stroke is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security , don &apos;t ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but shake their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; holiday homes for refugees , single @-@ se@@ ers , ear@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real estate contractor Markus Gil@@ dner is building terra@@ ced houses for people , who do not have much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing but also the mother and the poor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to get cheap and well @-@ built even today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepreneur , Markus Gil@@ dner , believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds holiday homes for refugees in a project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the people stay here , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very simple , three @-@ storey holiday home is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs least space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different , if one puts people in living blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for each of four asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say it is again peace , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally en@@ acted my project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ cle@@ tian value of special construction and the position regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the cities , the place is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents respond to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : there were , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which is definitely not right .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the educ@@ ating mother or the ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build today , cheap and good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what it is all about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ dner ( 44 ) studied micro@@ systems engineering in Regensburg , initially employing environmental analyses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message that tells you that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this may mean the removal of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely to do so when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install apps as soon as the process is complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to be continued since the phone may shut down by half way and may lead to a demo@@ lition of the update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should also make sure that you have seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things in order to prevent things wrong and protect if they do . iOS 9 brings new features , including a much wis@@ er personal assistant and tremendous new productivity features for the iPad , as well as changes that speed up and repair the operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the start in the decisive seven overseas races , the World Cup II emphasized that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 53 points separate the vice @-@ champion before the night race in Singapore , this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve season races so far , and also hit the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on managed to win the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for days , a Dun@@ st@@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded three months ago , Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen has added another member in his ranks , thus the number of members increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who held more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the winner of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , 1st class and honorary citizen of the cities Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann was supported by a donation to the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to include chess players who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of its connection with the spa town is seen .
district office is looking for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ assisted Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Old People &apos;s Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the clo@@ ak of the Social Foundation , opening up a new stop at Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to consultations , you can also participate in courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Social Foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new district office has recently opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice seekers receive information on questions such as health insurance or health insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have established our out@@ patient care service that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new house owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and citizen hospital , as well as for the ambul@@ ant service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore you can use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement center for care and care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , both business managers see particularly in demographic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future is essential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined himself at the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to regular soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the Social Foundation will make a huge contribution to the sen@@ iors to live independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Vienna architect Karl M@@ ang died at the age of 92
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he died on September 5 at the age of 92 , as the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with M@@ ang the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus loose an honorary member and at the same time one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as a freelance architect since 1952 , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

parking : Tim Wiese deplo@@ ys a polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex @-@ foot b@@ aller Tim Wiese is ung@@ u@@ ded in Bremen , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foot@@ ball@@ ers once were , meanwhile Tim Wiese , ex @-@ Nation@@ alists in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim is engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not admit it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Bre@@ mer downtown , he just cut out his hair when he saw how outside a parking assistant put a ticket on his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon she r@@ ushed out of business , insul@@ ted the officer and threw her the fine fine of money before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; said the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only after that , I decided whether meadow will be displayed , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fertile soil and the rainforest @-@ typical climate of Is@@ la del R@@ ey are ideally suited for mar@@ row the marijuana plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three days , Panama &apos;s authorities have carried out the 4@@ 500 plants and burn them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men beat on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the gas station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , beating this with the fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a nas@@ al frac@@ ture , and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when his two friends were hur@@ rying and deb@@ ating on the bat , he first retired from his sacrifice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car to their apartment , and demonstr@@ atively passed over several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle anymore , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using a stroke pitch , you beat on the face and th@@ igh of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to provide medical care , the injured person had to be taken to a hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , only a vag@@ ue script description is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters tall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second ra@@ cket was about 1,@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with a pair of jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked for witnesses and signs to report on the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank Müller takes over field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Minister of Economic Affairs , U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs , are also pleased to welcome the mayor of the mayor of Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice field breaks on 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will still have half a job in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened its practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros into the premises at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the Fel@@ den@@ aus@@ ens met with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently had completed her specialist training in the gil@@ ding hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ stein and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the couple was able to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in the D@@ RK @-@ Will@@ ing @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 19 September , the practice is being prepared for the new boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ stan@@ dig as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ ler , both inter@@ ne@@ ists , want to settle down as domestic doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ G and need a speaking room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy of € 50@@ 000 received the land@@ fill as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice Fel@@ den@@ ausen each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is yet another practice practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a positive side effect of the practical transfer by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor has come , it would have gone too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who visits Müll@@ ers &apos;s speech , is still looking for familiar faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practiced for 30 years there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen is smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband supplements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pushed myself from gardening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also driven up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister for the Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum would also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling to Austria and Germany , and may also build corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia will rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to rule out its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees in the night hours had already tried to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the nearby fields of ma@@ ize , the Croatian police were able to attack them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has constantly met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country expects about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo would take part in the Ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border which previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied it to be wise to suggest certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses were expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passengers had been traveling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , around 500 kilometres away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has promised , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel to Germany in Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , it could indeed come to a somewhat further west @-@ lying route to a slightly further west @-@ west route to observers of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive means of border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stated earlier that , in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , his country had prepared suitable plans for possible exemp@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not name details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area , stringent controls are carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony regarding the standard of border checks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Serbian side , there are still 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are going to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic was trying to calm down the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently be a very high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
migrants advise migrants to - dangerous - Alternative
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing maps to refugees on which alternative routes are drawn into Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Cro@@ at War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearance in the border region was sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok should have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber crime , which has been accused of giving rise to un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , insi@@ der shops should be made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , investig@@ ators have been rel@@ aun@@ ched more than 100 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trials against 32 more accused in the case lasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators are to have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe , as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
active operation prev@@ ails around the Mannheim P@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people carry out their worries , sometimes fast pac@@ ing , partly comfortable and stroll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
holding city lanes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with a beautiful autumn sun and in the middle four large sheets each with the heading &quot; Bev@@ or I die ... &quot; .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce gave attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite faced with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by , as well as for questions and talks , like the volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ use the chal@@ k and watched the set about &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read the War &quot; or &quot; do not suffer for long &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again there are little discussions on the action , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that some@@ when the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic plant Mannheim , which is jointly with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action to 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tables is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and death is still subject to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has made a great contribution to the opening of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was seeking Hon@@ orary President , she reported immediately and was there during the founding in 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 honorary volunteers - 43 women and two men - affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all well trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her task and the experiences made and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , hold it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant o@@ ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial support for health insur@@ ances and donations from relatives and associations enables training , as well as training and supervision of the death and funeral directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every two years , training for new employees is offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex result bl@@ ended to reduce financial outlook for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter and the supplier gi@@ ant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that she plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade , 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said making a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 cent less than with earlier forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ , analysts expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and is effective on 4 January , despite higher impacts for heavy and large packages which will be raised in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase over the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; solid yields , considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which analysts predicted twelve of Z@@ acks investment research analysts predicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to EUR 12.@@ 3 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of the analysts asked analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit express shipment to stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; net transport increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ assurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the after@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to € 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve returns strategy two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras &apos; ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the motto for the first time for nearly a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threatening above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story seat hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ Chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a two @-@ time mandate from the Congress : to maximize US employment and prices , here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled from the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data on the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the over@@ pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are observing , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of econom@@ ists , recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , predicted a rate increase this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow by promising that another increase is far removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or at 1.4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was caused by expectations that the F@@ ed policy uph@@ eld the sentence this week , said Mr Lon@@ ski , head of chief at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would ease the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary to increase the proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks like full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary impact of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the month , after China had utilized its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would throt@@ tle global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now close to 10 % below the pole of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when interest rates should be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy did not occur in the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month , in order to get the effects better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be considered technically in the decision @-@ making process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank was enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of Ben S. Bern@@ anke , then in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could narrow its monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to provide a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management by En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patent pending member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which uses a rate increase , cited decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recognis@@ able impacts on growth in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives reversed these cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the market launch in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il do not come close to that level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation where she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are exciting , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed I do not believe it should hurry up time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market which is also sold to the general public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried products , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is even a car division when you need engine oil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the whole shopping process makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the g@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) located in this store is close to the c@@ asses , and has different taking options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; products are cheap , and a number of them are sold in large quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat shop is extensive , as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good part of the cargo belongs to the massive frozen section . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , cattle blood , fish balls , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who bu@@ ys here : owner and coo@@ ks , individual families and individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ fts .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cash desk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , at Chin@@ at@@ own and the city centre - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own park grounds , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well @-@ visited , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Life Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give you a warm welcome , not without the dedication of countless volunteer hel@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with her body and soul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her 74 L@@ enzen , she still likes to teach her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seekers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is quite a different lesson than at a proper school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pap@@ al society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian Pap@@ al Organization SP@@ RS attempts to elu@@ ci@@ date women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck off breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that mothers should make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , demonstrated that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemp@@ tions for the new amber sports hall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipal council , Bern@@ ried , approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof may become fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for long @-@ awaited gymnas@@ tics at the amber sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the most recent council session , the processed building application was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the committee had decided on an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tax exemp@@ tion from a valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the permission was for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a non @-@ mit@@ er First and Dach@@ sh@@ ank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the &quot; liberation , &quot; in turn , the roof tendency was set to lie below ten degrees for energetic reasons - unlike in the building plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof extension leaves no &quot; exceptions &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Joint Council usually proceeds more restric@@ tively for liber@@ ating applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports hall at the sports centre is a joint project for the municipality , and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the expense , approximately EUR 2.3 million are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the administrative office for testing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is to be closed earlier than planned , namely in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority , with fishermen and the further existing inside station , should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not want to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ au clinic since the beginning of the year , has now moved to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the management from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Haus in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; upgrade &quot; and an extension of the range in the &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; range , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next two years Fischer is said to have worked with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ en@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , is supposed to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the District District had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ates that the house which is owned by the federal government should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a conference psychology are accommodated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; said Fischer via the Qu@@ asi reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a senior physician for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure and detach@@ ments were closed , for example surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are required tonight ( 8@@ pm ) at the Berg@@ ische HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wuppertal , the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga was the clear mark in Wuppertal . however , no one exists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener took a painful defeat at the Bh@@ c and got something to do there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jag@@ utter with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought into hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it could come to the accident , it was unclear at first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz victim of violent crimes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime @-@ suspi@@ cious has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz , missing since Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 year old admitted that young people were killed and their bodies were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last Saturday , 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the public prosec@@ utor and police hur@@ ried on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as susp@@ ects , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old was also deemed to be active on Tuesday evening who , in fact , conf@@ essed the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning , after having arrived home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when searching for a young woman , investig@@ ators initially met on personal items of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was finally found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the arrested was reported to have killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information about the immediate conditions of action should bring further investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is tense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are seeking an affordable ble@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution wars on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built up to 2020 each year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study commissioned by the association &quot; Social housing construction &quot; is commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an accommodation facility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many come to the housing market , and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were living in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant changes in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a residential deficit , which will grow from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , around 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ined Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , many working people lived in large cities in shared rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market , young adults stayed longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; suggests a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives are to revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the property tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments could be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , attractive tax depreciation conditions are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cities and municipalities , the subsi@@ dy programme for refugees in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the approximately 300 million euros have already been accessed on Monday evening with a total of 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia arrange corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no transit , there more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb has announced that the transit across Slovenia to the north , without hur@@ dles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the route is dangerous however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Slov@@ ene Minister of Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria , and is already part of the Schengen zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the killing of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported by the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day before Hungary , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day do not require proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can go through , and we prepare for that possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id , both by bus and taxi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees are not facing a border f@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the border strip holds other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , however , there are little more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police numbered 3@@ 66 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the closing of the door on Monday , it was 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws under@@ mine the overcoming and damage of the border crime as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the Sz@@ eg@@ ed border town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sentenced to five years in prison , and deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday , including almost all 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees stuck there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , no one has a view to get granted asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lock@@ ers were disman@@ tled , and one of the reception centres in the border was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody wanted to express himself to the goal of this conversion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only reaching a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the country has reinforced its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to government figures , however , more than 20,000 migrants still remained in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge festival we were busy with the clearing when ten people stood at the tent entrance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Passa@@ u by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria because of the influ@@ x of refugees in Austria , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the br@@ anded with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , we met the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snacks and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man could not take it , to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the str@@ anded train passengers went on Sunday evening in W@@ els from a ICE train to Passa@@ u , after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped in Germany , but still to try over the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the regional train was stopped at the Inn before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge @-@ festival was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , Friday before a two @-@ bridge run sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has sent thousands of thousands to us now , is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the attitude of the Hungarian government into the ha@@ ze world of National Socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guiding these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poultry must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter , for us to make decent states for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the support of refugees , Konrad has fully done all his hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad , it is used to say that his word has a weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers , to raise funds for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the chaos in the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen Initi@@ ation Centre has already been under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great fuss , Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad expects 8@@ 5,000 lod@@ gings in the he@@ ur@@ ful year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to fulfil the number , more than 35@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 of them are to provide 15,000 to the federal government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can create it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the provincial authorities , he has already held talks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born tomorrow , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Asyl@@ um Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that district bear@@ ers must respect a certain amount of towel holder or size of the duties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , in contrast to the interior of the interior , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of the un@@ truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their number of employees , they want to increase to three to four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , our own quest for districts has not been successful yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are obviously problems with the permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for refugees are planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one can currently under@@ line those affected without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of an emergency , however , other sites should be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism has been critic@@ ised by the President of the parti@@ tioning of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other districts also have to contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) concluded the further action in refugee issue on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me , that the German borders are not sealed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany remains possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the seekers were taken to Germany with regular trains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria once again controls on its borders , it is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans at P@@ ühr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Die Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; general renovation in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is now officially closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building is the listed IT group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later to acquire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at EUR 1.7 million , S &amp; T invested 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building is adapted from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T , as well as Tech@@ Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres remaining in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ ing wanted to get a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now grown up in the form of another local local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything is now about ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long wondered whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the large @-@ area Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been put in the cra@@ dle by her mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most , when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why some women are looking for a nice hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the specialist lady cannot answer with the last security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe it &apos;s up to you , that a beautiful bag is util@@ ised every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this property links many people with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he expresses himself alien@@ ably , re@@ alizes journalists or reveal knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whir@@ ls up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate domain come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker , with the F@@ öhn@@ fresh@@ ur , is a term for many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant village are related to it , over -@@ ei@@ ghty corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ all@@ stadt leader Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villa@@ gers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt Art , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native town of K@@ all@@ stadt has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous kids , including the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz , beside Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too , with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the king of the hearts , he has not brought it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit of a great mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dently the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the perim@@ eter , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the licens@@ er , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold min@@ ers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundations of the real estate company were first real estate purchases in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to the homeland , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t record Tr@@ ump because he once was without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ alz history and folk song , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants , this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Polish , this is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ daughter was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker retired rather distances the American , &quot; he is always so many thousand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the host@@ ess Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ after a visit which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this of Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the choice because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie lon@@ ers , even in the United States awak@@ ens interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mountain@@ eering Village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominated the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the liber@@ als leadership , but there were no major shifts in the Today reviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this disadvantage of the board seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five capitals , compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , Today , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most interesting , which happens every morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the winds of change concern the dawn more than parliament !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son was able to carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fters Star Re@@ be@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven was strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe in an average of 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia , N@@ ine will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail around 5 : 30 PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars , which didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally published as &quot; Sun@@ rise , &quot; while Today remains local &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have unknow@@ ingly recognized who The Bachelor &apos;s wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the woman , finally ends at The Bachelor &apos;s College in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one , who received the last rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam wood holds his lips tightly sealed to the final on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have been ly@@ rical to why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is put , &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ ep Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay , as the best partner for Wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I noticed in the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed , I felt they were fairly compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ ep &apos;s Fel@@ lows said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s home visit made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked to whom wood should choose , if not her , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the remaining girls , it is an un@@ decided between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor &apos;s degree is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally released as Sarah first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some trainers could have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench as he lost a fight as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League @-@ convert at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return , and also in the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room , after the match . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his press conference , Hay@@ ne also strengthened himself in his press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordin@@ ators Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a punch that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian follow@@ er for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne pos@@ ing for a photo with fans , keeping an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s rich@@ est man , was arrested on a Siber@@ ian wheelchair with arms violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky was sentenced to seize his oil company Yu@@ kos and under@@ took his democratic endea@@ vors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters are demanding the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn retreat in Grand@@ wall@@ stadt before a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get rein@@ for@@ cements in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until Friday , the State fraction of the Free Elec@@ tors g@@ athers in the Frank@@ ish Commune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , quite different main themes were planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees now dominates the free elec@@ torate , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as it was during the Yugoslavia war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we must go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected asylum seekers , Free voters want to push the Free voters away as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we needed uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes away and others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must become more capable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country policy should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long @-@ standing favourite is on the agenda , the education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , Cultural Affairs Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; intermediate level plus &quot; where an extension of the secondary school stage of three to four years is being tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that &apos;s not far enough , Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we demand freedom of choice for all gym@@ nasi@@ ums that want to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free driving at the G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wall Street Hel@@ ps Da@@ x on the jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long distance , the German stock market has closed gro@@ unded and nervous commercial operations with profits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon a firm opening of the US stock markets provided a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , the D@@ ow Jones Index quoted some 1 percent in plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stock markets expect the markets to be in place until after the interest decision in the USA , and also for the big fall on the fut@@ ures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has shifted the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , leaving deep marks even at E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered a bit , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the Da@@ x peak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the U.S. investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; looked after the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , investors obliged to pay little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , investment in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and focus should pay attention to the car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
auto @-@ values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August more cars were sold once more than in the same period of the previous year as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the launch of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daimler and BMW &apos;s papers grew by 1.@@ 34 percent , respectively 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the German pension market , the return on stock of listed Federal tagged papers amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ x Swiss Life index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , the course of the euro fell to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had fixed the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 People killed , after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police viol@@ ently demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , chief district officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of which threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ hak@@ al said that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air , before resor@@ ting to rubber floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber soles used , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid would say that new provinces , formed within the proposed new constitution , would l@@ essen their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent disputes since the 10th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to split the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial subject in Nepal , has been governed centrally for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process of the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , the city is preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; planned is a mix of trade , commerce and living - but there is no concrete offer yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plan is to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; waiting for appropriate quotes , it is called the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which investor would come into question , is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts have been concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the ring road / corner of Great Street , already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ieve project : details are on the table
the planning for a holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den takes shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor presented public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gre@@ ased , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea are near Em@@ den on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP faction , presented by the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on to answer all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is good to be able to counter all the rum@@ ours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners who had come to the meeting , caused the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ book owner and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z overlooked by all the others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears like some other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what happens on the well @-@ hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google launches a doubled donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations , which will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusual personal approach to the announcement of the donation campaign , on his blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of letting a manager announce the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who was woven with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe grew , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations offering assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Fron@@ tiers , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / from er@@ eli@@ ef to 11 million $ will be doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has sold more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also escaped from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for obes@@ e diab@@ etics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , if slightly overweight people with diabetes can live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a leading article on the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven to be efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c @-@ scar@@ ring - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who underwent a surgical procedure , 36 % of diabetes was completely lost and at 28 % in part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was entirely dissolved in one percent and in some cases with only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers also monitored hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood blood levels , which reflects blood sugar values over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , thus the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ er@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and recorded more diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of severely disabled people in Sweden that surgery results in a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study , because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is an issue that is becoming increasingly important in Bell@@ et@@ r@@ istik : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the s@@ warm of her youth , and he falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rü@@ cker readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler , and is pleased that she could put a literary memorial to her home town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for the end of the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford who dedic@@ ates itself to ethics studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria engaged in addressing the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September , indicating that the violent reaction of the US attracted a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 11 September I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence , and this caused unexpected consequences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swallow up strong alcoholic drinks of hand , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of recei@@ pts from hand@@ dis@@ infection agents in children under 12 years of age , reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children deliberately drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ing in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
young people have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with non @-@ alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragran@@ ces of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in small children , few sp@@ lashing can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume plenty of alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Rus@@ sell , a six year old girl who recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to an emergency room for treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that was legally drunk by an adult , Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated them in the winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah wa@@ its her words , and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had hit his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health authorities have suggested that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students planned for the fourth class in New York State to poison their &quot; mil@@ dly &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the en@@ gros@@ sed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a rear @-@ end collision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old driver was slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver went to the industrial area on the cross @-@ pole in direction of the round@@ about , realizing it was too late that the round@@ about had stopped two vehicles ahead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , he colli@@ ded with his lor@@ ry into the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a pending Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of vehicles involved in the accident , there was a loss of about 10,000 euros , the police are divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer travelling , and had to be tow@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smells Kitchen : no D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing the talk of D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the Ho@@ ops are on a bad place , but that he will turn it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hear@@ ts will fight S@@ FA because of N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation , and war@@ bur@@ ton should be cautious in January @-@ new commitments which could destroy the unit of the squ@@ ad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ons increase guidance over Celtic to five points , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ro@@ on@@ ey &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave Aber@@ deen a scar@@ ce victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ ra@@ dri@@ e , making the D@@ ons a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control because they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring , de Bo@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that is what they are interested in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Celtic had to fight , but the Norwegian chief s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen was followed by five points ahead clearly at the top of the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , we want to come out as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel this exactly the way , but we must continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
getting together is so important .
war@@ bur@@ ton carefully in January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , only a few weeks ago , he pointed out that he hur@@ ried several January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is careful about signing new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to interfere with the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players who come in the summer have this Pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Celtic Dest@@ ination Mich@@ u with a withdrawal note
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a troubles@@ ome kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les for two years , and has not managed the whale &apos;s finish this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts posted on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts performed 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the Defender was later repe@@ aled - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said , and insisted : &quot; I have no integrity , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ co@@ aster
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ repaired hi@@ ker was corrected after he admitted , having sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts players Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident took place in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh , in front of an Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ co@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the Stür@@ mer , &quot; It is certain to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ co@@ aster when it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the Board of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team , but that the decline must end on the playing field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ nel@@ ly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; win &quot; off against Hamilton . &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to win a seventh consecutive League victory that gave them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cups or le@@ agues , the games of this type have won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK , unemployment is rising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July in 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole rose to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the figures for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.2 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken disrup@@ ting the flow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as security guards could not bring peace , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could take the stur@@ geon in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a breath alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0.@@ 89 pro mil@@ le .
the growing child was picked up by his mother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le , and initially remained in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why I will be witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary if Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injec@@ tor .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation came for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be selected , will see it emotion@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we often laugh a lot , when we speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me on Twitter , to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I don &apos;t want to go back to all details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective , I will see him dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porters , to which you can contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you get from me is , what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man after firing police chase persu@@ aded to get out of the C@@ anning River
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man &apos;s attempt to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , trying to gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called to a break @-@ in incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben c@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car into the dit@@ ch to avoid drinking alcohol and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben @-@ c@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a Spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity section and claimed that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t test at Li@@ dar@@ i which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age charges , and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know , that it continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tonight , I will go home and sleep well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , I must think about what I do with my license . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ers that the integrity department tried to spy on his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will appoint when I am asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they seem to believe , that I am a liar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to hold me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , the reign@@ ing President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should this be the opinion , that it will be personally ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly , and maybe people outside of trainers are responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe people think outside , that I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say will let you think about it now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and they urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainers &apos; fru@@ stration levels have built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the slaugh@@ tered Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the racing course &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which was pushed against the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has mistakenly put mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had , however , so on the race day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the day of the race .
it is a joke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested for driver &apos;s flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and a driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered with serious injuries to the Royal Melbourne hospital , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia came to Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is likely to be charged due to the assistance of the driver and the assistance of other traffic off@@ ences , as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals , because of claims relating to ring fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised Tac@@ kling his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ire @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team allowed his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a hard @-@ disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ b of his team , and said that at tac@@ kling they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criti@@ ques of two leading trainers to his team strongly agree , because they worried that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit a shock to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s funny , as it always appears at this time of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we look exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy also pointed out , that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ ster scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are p@@ auses , or are there any points of tension ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the game plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekend , the Storm team was free to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ser@@ beer with $ 200,000 deposit on drug delivery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence threatened to get into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ accused during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the risk of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars constitutes a real financial burden , &quot; said Justice Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police daily and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : cab suspen@@ sions apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a rear end with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the three trucks participating were bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver noted it too late , trying in vain to turn left to the left as the police announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked over six hours , until 2 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the telephone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s telephone when she was asleep and logged in an online mess@@ aging service which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing , and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it , found the confusing messages and immediately al@@ armed their mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took care of and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research which used terms to search for un@@ decent images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted that searches on computers were carried out by him , but he said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on trem@@ bling and weeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone , and confronted the accused with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused was using computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls , who looked much younger than he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment alleged to have viol@@ ated in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year and did not appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his disappearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael van@@ ishes the verdict until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit , but was kept in provisional custody for hear@@ ings on other occasions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the sentence .
tu@@ re@@ users avoid small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken up , away from the large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fear of discovery and arrest , many smu@@ dges were increasingly losing people at smaller border cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees were picked up in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had reached the German side on foot , over bridges and ri@@ fl@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they are taken from the Federal Police and sent to the registry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the weekly start on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station once again met more refugees than on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 AM , said a spokesman in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : runner from the tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the south @-@ west awaits
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meteor@@ ologists warn of storm @-@ storms in the southwest of wed@@ n@@ esday , wed@@ n@@ esday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) is now moving into Stuttgart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low was the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected , especially in Baden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still possible to calculate between 60 and 90 kilometers per hour in the Black Forest , the Schwä@@ bische Al@@ b and the Lake Con@@ stance with sheets of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun is shining again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass makes it : every two years , the makers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is primarily a movement among the compact cars , which currently sell very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compact class cars are currently especially popular : around 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in the autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel introduces a gateway to the biggest competitor of VW Golf , which will start at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current Astra will cost € 16@@ 9@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine , with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially just five @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which is already visible at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what will happen next to the Astra at the International Motor Show , next to the Astra ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault will send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is only a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 is completely new in the segment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan Cab@@ inet wishes to find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to manufacturer data , the maximum torque is 170 Nm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe , spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers above all laid hands on the front . here the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lamps equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed and the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen , and the first Apple Car@@ Play was integrated for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of cell , human @-@ un@@ worthy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court granted Te@@ gel an ex @-@ prisoner of prison , which was stored for months in a small cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a resolution published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court decided that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was housed in the Det@@ ention Centre Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who is now on the free foot according to his lawyer , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the country of Berlin , his arrest warrant failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court rejected the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and re@@ mitted the case back to the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity offen@@ ded .
chamber Court now decides about the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons only a few days of detention for the compensation were author@@ itative , a compensation was given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a violation of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money reimbur@@ sement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus they did not speak to a prisoner in April , because he was imprisoned in a cell naked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human un@@ worthy decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe furthermore confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , who had certified a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three months , the pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the tense situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Court of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young people , 19 are expected to drop in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will be able to record a million refugees according to the Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments each year - for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the lack of living space is dramatic , especially at affordable rental objects : annually 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price , and in order to make these particularly affordable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is the result of the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view : 80@@ ,000 social housing annually would have to arise and the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , scientists and federal mini@@ stries agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( IAB ) , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany were not asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Mr Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial to find a job in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the recording company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says Mig@@ rant researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise labour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a prohibition of work for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the duty of the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled workers , it is mostly the point of view that refugees should be quicker access to the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the structure of networks is , according to the opinion of Thr@@ en@@ hardt , the Königs@@ weg to work integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ as , spokesperson for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the benefits of the ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialist schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students are prepared in teaching classes without knowledge of German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are not always taught by qualified teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suit@@ cases from the Berlin school administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk ( German Studenten@@ werk ) estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , no federal state forbi@@ ds asylum seekers or the study - the only exception was Berlin , Interior Senator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has quit his position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for refugees , admission to the university could be facilit@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a compensation or de@@ priv@@ ation do not receive services according to the asylum application law any more when they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , the latter does not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , as it does not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span will be shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , and Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually sweep the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ Christian right to a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
duties are also part of the rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear persons and be willing to work with the state in many areas and to give him certain control possibilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism belongs to this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to negotiate such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he suggested transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - for almost a decade , an anti @-@ discrimination institute and a general equality law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same chances for all : what migrants and stakeholders of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism of Germany are committed must become reality in the coming years - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what concerns man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money must be flowing into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery claims to susp@@ end all newcom@@ ers right from the registration of health cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , services rendered could be accounted for by the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to remove so many people with the limited power catalogue , which fores@@ ees the asylum application law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are well informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in clinics but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would need to be taken over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many refugees were also helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are considerably more un@@ treated disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some other clinical pictures , German doctors come from their training but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attack or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; and what concerns the lack of doctors , is possibly even allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have had a highly developed education system , some refugees even have doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they must demonstrate their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates of the Federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill : most suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp arrives trau@@ mati@@ sed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who suffer from a trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulties , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , an early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can submit an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social departments , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , social workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illness would also decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst uses the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal combines and unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst load into the Man@@ ege on the brick @-@ w@@ ases to dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , an instructor and junior professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the actual man@@ tra @-@ production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the gift to the lovers lies in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to bring people away from their everyday mo@@ ck@@ ery and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with world city flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the program of the cir@@ cus convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws attention to the audience with wit and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to take up the Cuban duo loos@@ ely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst with a sense of inst@@ inct and articul@@ ation fascin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yu@@ an no problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten , at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascinated with their mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals , however , are only too often a matter of different animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst has a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we won &apos;t go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy each str@@ ing@@ ering unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they are called aff@@ ection@@ ately , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the top priority is good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on their zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals lived together for eight years , and nothing happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our small Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ roid isn &apos;t ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each visitor , something should be present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; no matter if there are five or more 200 people , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 17 to 20 September , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas from 17 to 20 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , this entry is only available in Deutsch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium in the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by the opposition members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they had bu@@ sted it and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spokesman of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that the immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave Parliament , its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings initiatives in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP will split into two listed companies this year , separating the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected reduction in jobs leads to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a stand @-@ alone company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing up @-@ to @-@ date , integrated technology solutions for companies &quot; so an explanation of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it spl@@ its a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP has completed a massive restructuring , to tackle the turning of traditional PCs into mobile devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the belief that closely focused businesses perform better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates have to stand against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger emphasized that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his involvement in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended his last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that does not heal properly .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in contact with his an@@ kles , or with the injuries he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger acknowledged , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also develops an unpleasant pattern , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere , since his debut six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he played in only 65 of arsen@@ als , 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wider picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting strength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arsen@@ al starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger sets up a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to continue through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ date effect in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco , and remains driven by far hope to lead the association to its first European debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked with Arsen@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ative ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a pi@@ tiful life ) was announced in 2015 by the goal of asking men to seek help if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noticed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of communication managed through social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , lifel@@ ong and successful , even if in reality isolation is dominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ tr@@ ic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gl@@ ared by the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments with football matches in cozy arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can definitely go back to explore their feelings completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y , I told me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and are self @-@ ordained has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria will help PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French Master on the way but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally achieved their lead when Cav@@ ani got a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Transpar@@ ent Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it is not only aiming for qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities before the gate . later he was replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents problems and look back even though there are certain things we have to perfect during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury which could hold a 2 : 2 un@@ decided in his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was designated as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he ran in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind Malm@@ ö &apos;s defense before he ended up in Johan Wil@@ and past beautiful in the long corner of the network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic in a play @-@ off stroke to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a strong opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but apart from a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some failures and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was in the first half only in the first half and then abandoned after inser@@ ting him after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill in bringing his fellow players into play , and it was a pass of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c that Di Maria turned into a shooting which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . in doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans received his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ pp@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k from Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that ended all the thought that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi witnessed a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later said that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
keep your hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion dollars by stock sales , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; located in Switzerland , the Gl@@ en@@ core mining giant , which is affected by collap@@ sing raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its huge scho@@ oling plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth about 1.6 billion pounds in order to pay off its own debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that has lost 57 percent of its market value this year is fighting with falling commodity prices , because China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issu@@ ance of rights of rights brought a rapid increase to the top of the London stock exchange on Wednesday morning , on the early Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share jumped by 2.6 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ en@@ core had announced $ 2.5 billion of stock sales last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around one @-@ third of its 30 billion dollars debts , announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9,@@ 99 percent of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns in China &apos;s long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices decreased by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , 49 people reach the municipal administration in Weimar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee comes from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the youngest newcom@@ er is a six month old girl from Syria .
white House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ing &apos;s visit to Washington
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and returns President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan in a state d@@ iner , after the two leaders have held bilateral discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President &apos;s visit will offer the opportunity to expand the American Chinese cooperation with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , at the same time giving President Obama and President X@@ i to design areas of dis@@ agreements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , whose visit was announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on its way to Washington before proceeding to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns in relation to alleged cy@@ ber @-@ spi@@ on@@ age China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borrow@@ ed 440 @-@ hp sports cars , and drove to S@@ cra@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to meet a dream , and made a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the wet highway , then the evil awak@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a company in the district of Got@@ ha , one can fulfil the dream and once again bor@@ row a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang boss 30@@ 2 with 440 b@@ hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , this did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the district Got@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , fell on wet tra@@ jec@@ tory and drove into the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports car suffered dead damage , no one was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material damage is estimated at 40,000 EUR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 switch to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , Bayern Munich was just before the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion League , four times champion League Champion , two times champion champion , two times champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and joined the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now tells him that he stood before the Euro 2008 before the departure from Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that , too , is the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann passed the FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardian was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the decisive man is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola and played a great European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he gets me crazy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows Bavaria &apos;s playing time 2008 / 2009 would be run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against Bavaria over the whole distance on the lawn , switched off the Red Army ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the royal class triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said , she is not needed behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night by HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protag@@ onist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; when the commentary of the actor by The Mar@@ tian confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers &apos; colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People has opted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said , &quot; At the end , their direction &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter users expressed anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its publication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ age Michael Brown killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide efficacy and urged authorities and authorities to stop discrimin@@ ating practices against coloured inclusions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made an appeal to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still weaker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ es invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional sport clim@@ ber and user aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete , who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took the Grand Prix of 1 million $ with home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which has just completed its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of its obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the last part , climbing was part of a 75 foot climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time that he was the first athlete to finish the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster than he did for the winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his bunch of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it will be the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , he receives the great atro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he has a res@@ ent@@ ment over it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is just so happy to have done , what he did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think , Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , and the filming will begin in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tiger flies past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , they once were one of the best bas@@ eball teams , today the tig@@ ers are standing at the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ali@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit points three times in the first two inner ring , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 internally , and enabled three R@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to throw each game in the bull@@ pen , and so I want to go into the game completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first Triple @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , clearly looked better out in the bull@@ pen , and he put it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ stage at the end of the seventh race , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Right Fiel@@ der Aaron &apos;s Hi@@ cks reached a bun@@ ny , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ or to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy ran wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the design@@ ate R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen to run a Two @-@ Run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the end of the second run , Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ge a Double Play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ge proposed a Double Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth round , wall created an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right @-@ handed , however , set forth S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit benefited from a still not mo@@ ve@@ able Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two internal rings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been canc@@ eled before the game of the injuries list after he had been missing more than one month because of a back suffering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after winning the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , he gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abol@@ ished his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tig@@ ers grew up in the second , scored a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hit very well , but he caught the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored points in the third inning before being replaced by A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter &apos;s right @-@ handed reli@@ ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the lit@@ ters .
he is resear@@ ched by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder distortion , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability list to start beating the T@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hundreds of refugees are to come down in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who arrived in Wiesbaden will then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees coming to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily be accommodated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , they should be distributed to other communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past ten days alone , 6,@@ 500 people in Hessen have arrived in Hessen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the large number of refugees in Spor@@ th@@ allen , Frankfurt and Han@@ au also have shel@@ ved emergency shel@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ Isch@@ inger : military action in Syria , an option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not take place without Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he threw the European states &quot; collective action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , one had been happy that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the former Ambassador in Washington also called for massive escal@@ ation of international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Minister of Interior , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , no refugees have returned to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there had already been discussions between the Director General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not call them concrete figures , and promised to hold talks on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers will take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on Tuesday , 22 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee transmission in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will manage this together with the countries , and announced Merkel at the late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of consultations with the Prime Minister in the German Chancellor &apos;s Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection , also complain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly shared in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , thousands of desperate refugees stuck in the Balkan Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later the government announced in Budapest , even the border to Romania with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from escap@@ ing over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of other migrants to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s moon , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sp@@ ends a global ocean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the moon is easily til@@ ting around the ring plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this motion is only small , but nevertheless too big for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon , sp@@ ew water vap@@ or and ice particles and feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed back then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama is missing in 1860 for several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around one month in 1860 , Val@@ det R@@ ama has to ren@@ ounce the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation has yiel@@ ded an ad@@ duc@@ tor failure at the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association distributed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the week , R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Lion , the diagnosis is about four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a big loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n to the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a single professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium , and was already under contract at V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his bra@@ ins , Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player should enter the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , with a strong collision at the head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to the first fears , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B @-@ vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain plenty of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when purchasing , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and pleasant to smell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe fruit is , so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they taste pure , pure or in sweet foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads , such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Christmas business in the USA , the US @-@ parcel service U@@ PS represents up to 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the recruitment of seasonal workers , the company announced that U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , drivers are being sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year U@@ PS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 hel@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making provisions for Christmas business since last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries delayed the package services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at first F@@ öhn@@ sturm : then striking cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine crossing of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and on the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows with the tor@@ till@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of a comprehensive deep @-@ print area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the mountain side of the Alps , during the night , the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows up to th@@ inn@@ s of 60 to 100 km / h , spor@@ adi@@ cally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land with over 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ öhn may advance up to the adjacent center edge , and even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible on the mountains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ eh@@ n fo@@ eh@@ n guarantees summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , moisture starts to st@@ ow away on the mountain slope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , rain starts to stop until Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be accounted for in the next 48 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning , a cold front with a strong , partly thunder@@ ous rain from west to east leads to Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the cold front , the wind eats strong until stor@@ ming , and temperatures clearly go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days show up in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , but in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now recognized as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been applied for by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical churches in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran congregation in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants could live in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority only in secret their faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the place I become symbo@@ lically visible , that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 , several months in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he felt the city back then , as obsol@@ ete , sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his thes@@ es , Luther had then introduced a split in the Oc@@ ci@@ dent Church with his thes@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works , painted by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but what is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it can be quite dark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has met a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , commandments or father@@ hood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he immediately fascinated several partners : this is true for the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological focus , as well as for the Kettler Publisher with its focus on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus translated into current context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these texts are , as verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are embedded in the original biblical context of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his personal thoughts on the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 , and grew up in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at times the up@@ bringing was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work this up to perhaps even tolerate my father &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more importance in a faster time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertising , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is suppressed .
artists have a different pleasure and joy to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like to let the viewer fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is seeking his counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost participated in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung presentation on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot; I like to have been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he mat@@ ures life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not paid attention to the fact that the Bible is fully embra@@ cing the Bible , but also the most important , mysterious subjects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; this is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X railways
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , space found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel morph@@ ed for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; failures in politics and administration ensured enjoyment , especially with the residents who did not want to tolerate the railways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus hill slo@@ ping up , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approval will take place in October , the first female coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will still happen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should then start without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensified engagement for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga was a clear sign on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is re@@ acting to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its aid in tac@@ kling the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I consider this for the greatest challenge of our country since the unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that &apos;s nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to be of interest to every individual to get this topic under control , &quot; said Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s office next Wednesday and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the pi@@ vot@@ al course must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said K@@ id@@ s@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they are going to bear the im@@ print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ head Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drama of refugees goes to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can do football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our beam force , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Ret@@ tig , managing director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ ney called the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their locations , is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as great , small and smallest clubs are active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this and the next year , the association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; said K@@ id@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP member of the executive board loses an eye in case of accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Executive Committee of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the United States , he fell to a water fro@@ sted after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bleeding , impot@@ ent , then dragged out to the road - he told us last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can pursue his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting , and &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was standing in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the S@@ Z : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a picture and explained that he suffered the injury , when he fell off the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he therefore arrives at night races in Singapore , just as little as a spare drive for the two common si@@ ots Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ K without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ around in the gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco R@@ eus were finally sm@@ ashed in the first group play of the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national player will also be missing the football leader of the Bundes@@ liga , with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot use it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top@@ spiel against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its core eleven on the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he announced a change on the door @-@ guard position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of the master @-@ keeper Roman brus@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Tu@@ ch@@ el was open to whether the turn@@ table will be used in all Europa League matches in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the for@@ sche statement of fellow player R@@ eus that the final campaign for B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal is to keep Julian Wei@@ gl : &quot; so Marco isn &apos;t so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grasp the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robotic cars : government wants to lead a pioneering role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be the technological prec@@ ur@@ sor to the transformation of the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the federal cabinet decided on a strategy paper from the home of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt , at the edge of the Auto Show IAA from a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport anticip@@ ates the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a spe@@ edy shift on digital radio communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to test new technology , a test track is currently being developed on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to have no additional liability risks , the Federal Government wants to review the legal framework and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , Germany is aiming at an international level to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Federal Government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only envis@@ ages people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automated driving , the car increasingly assumes leadership , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which detect the environment and process data in seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 will value around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD travel@@ er S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute , commissioned by the AA Institute on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that driving cars will prevail over the next ten years ; 32 percent do not believe that 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed expect an autonomous driving car in the US by 20@@ 25 , 33 percent in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control throughout the entire trip on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway , this could be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to present conditions in the title fight of September 25 to October 4 , the Düssel@@ dorfer will only be able to beat in singles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final decision will be made at the latest on September 22 , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo clin@@ ching the title , &quot; explains Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ing date in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated Single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ List in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Timo Scheider was also missing at that time , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the world @-@ ranking fifth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British football team , Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United , suffered a serious injury on the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow player of Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ itz , the first diagnosis pointed to a sh@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures , the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights : window mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is seen from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle des Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good chance that the fashion designer changed his attitude to a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little bit &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Canada , Montreal and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history , without ever completing a training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed complete artwork for which a lot of effort was done : to fr@@ ater@@ alize the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers made 14 tons of material bar@@ red in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest , a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l was there : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exhibition , Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ erly fashion designer &apos;s attempts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , he taught himself how to throw fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , but of course , I bought them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were developed in large quantities for customers , for example carp@@ eting and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this no longer works alone today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mobile Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt quotes a few examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who have no niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales were cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; private business , and wholesale , there is almost no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our products hardly reach our customers in this way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , export is weak@@ ening , currently to Russia and the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , enough reasons for new ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been introducing a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Arts Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories that need to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ invented the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the machine bu@@ cks small spheres at some places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ mi@@ er Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße was inspired by this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , she uses the snow ball for her jewelry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ um - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and want to have a memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; film
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to touch legends , but Disney dar@@ es to make a new movie of his classic &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a re@@ fil@@ ment , but a kind of continuation that takes 20 years after the first film with the magical Child Girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already fixed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI demands to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wider out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned to steer the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls politics , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that do not qualify for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system is tested gradually , and improved by test programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of importance as it assign@@ s a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , making it more open to the market and open the market more open , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also l@@ ure control over the powers transferred to the companies , and make sure companies decide how to conduct their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow bor@@ der@@ lands to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic co @-@ operation and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang G@@ oli participated as reported in a declaration issued after the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double the mercury level in predat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ or fish and to cope with a much higher dose of nerve damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ood@@ watch consumer organisation , which has issued a corresponding paper paper , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy will be passed on with full impact on pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large predat@@ ory fish are already so strongly polluted with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values some 50 percent of the catches can not be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller peac@@ o@@ cks , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the lowering of frac@@ tion@@ ism is &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy metal which is highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause harm to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains its homepage with regard to current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is , above all , through coal combustion in the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information by the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations b@@ ash more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population issued in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , EU @-@ wide warnings against mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
