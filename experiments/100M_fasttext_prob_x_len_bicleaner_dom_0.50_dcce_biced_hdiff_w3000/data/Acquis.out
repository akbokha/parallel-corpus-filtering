&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with its own legal regulations in accordance with a specific product , Egypt uses quantity restrictions in the form of agents or de@@ vot@@ ees , so it treats the community as one entity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are competent , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This Convention shall be valid for non @-@ nuclear dis@@ armament , the contracting party of the Treaty ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is notified that its procedures are concluded for entry into force of this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) When the community of the organization is notified , that it is able to apply its security measures to this state for the purposes of this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The Organisation , the Community and the States refer each other to the request of one of the parties concerned about a change in this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) The General Director will immediately inform all Member States of the organization , regardless of any change in the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) This agreement entered into force on the day in which the organization of the Community and the States receive the written notification , that their procedures are completed for entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the Treaty Party of the Treaty is , for so long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents the convention and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedure to apply during the implementation of Part I , as required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim of the procedure of the security measures specified in this Convention is the timely detection of the degradation of significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a dis@@ approval by the risk of early detection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to enrich the target defined in Article 28 , material book@@ keeping is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial entry and observation as important complementary measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical conclusion of the inspection by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material which has not been proven for a specific period of time , speci@@ fies the accuracy limits for the given measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when performing their ex@@ ams , the organization after Article 3 makes full use of the securing system of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the implementation of their backup actions , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and measures will make use of the following manner and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are intended and useful in the complementary agreements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a measurement system for the determination of quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the core material and the inventory ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements , and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e ) method for assessment of accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F ) a protocol - and report system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in the material balance zone , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting to the Organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security measures , according to this agreement , do not extend to material in mining or ore treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) is referred to as ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet been achieved under the letter c ) , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced to specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) the core material , which is manufactured according to the composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle , is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) The provisions stipul@@ ated in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not met or desirable , the association and the community should consult each other on the application of suitable safegu@@ ards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ profit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upon request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the security measures following this Convention : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) special fis@@ sile material , if it is used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B ) nuclear material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this Convention , provided that the total amount of material freed due to this article in the states is at no time more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ pointed square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with accumulation of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium , with an accumulation of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the core material is to be processed or stored in accordance with the core material that is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures to that material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are required for the successful and effective realization of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures specified in the Convention apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the supplementary agreements may be extended or am@@ ended without a change in the agreement between the organization and the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts to make these agreements into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organisation provides a consolidated inventory of the core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and will continue to carry out this inventory account based on the subsequent reports and results of their follow @-@ up inspections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Economic Community ( EW@@ G ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special transaction programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income whose development is imp@@ eded by general management problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organisation will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D ) The E@@ EC and the organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed carrying out and administration of this agreement , as well as the SMEs to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the organization of the E@@ EC has presented a table , which is obvious in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Special Sec@@ urities Trading Account &quot; which is made by the Member States in accordance with this Agreement , and is used only for the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special transaction account is held separately , separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ ary debt of the member state that must be paid in the form of cash or un@@ ary bonds of the member state at the order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the disposal of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two instal@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the administration agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the E@@ EC and the administrator considering the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments to the above mentioned date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker reserves approximately proportional divi@@ den@@ ds on the cash or the school notes in order to cover the expenses for the transaction loans and balance the transaction account appropriately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors according to the E@@ EC conditions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service , and its further lending capacity to loan terms and conditions ; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VII ) to the extent , in which the problems of the concerned countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and quickly re@@ payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , regardless of whether it belongs to the loan program of the organization funded , approved and managed , with the aim of the pre@@ am@@ ble to be taken into account for this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of the funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organisation which has been approved by the Bank or the Organization by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions that apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; payments for the payment of this watch must be paid directly to the organization , which it retains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each transaction loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the income from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( i ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which the administrator has stipul@@ ated at the time of the loan guarantee to be a recipient of a transaction loan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be returned to the Member State as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans , the supervis@@ or teaches the E@@ EC on the projects and programmes approved by the directors to the audit by the directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the period of payment of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditure provided for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as possible , the manager transm@@ its a detailed account of the transaction account with a statement of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after full payment of the transaction loans , the manager of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the transaction account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the account received from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the withdraw@@ als to the Member States are evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until full edition of the means of a special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed by special transaction services , and all other issues affecting the provisions of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may be agreed upon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the total amount of all funds returned by the recipients to the member states is terminated and all the obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural rules of each party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities to conclude the proceedings concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the General Sec@@ retariat conduc@@ ts these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the regular approval of this agreement , through the E@@ EC to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement will take effect and enter into effect on the first day of the month , which follows the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement is written in two chapters in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter exchange for the amendment of the Protocol Section 1 to the Agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issued the following statement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation , in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test system called J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project whose construction and operation is named after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Common Company J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years , and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion still extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to speed up their respective research projects which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement should enable each contracting party to take advantage of the potential benefits provided for research work on the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity production by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve the aim of the present agreement , the parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programs in app@@ endi@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom @-@ Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program will take over the long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be expanded or modified in articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time the parties accept a new program , the program will take place in the place of the program listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association , intended in paragraph 1 , is carried out by : - appropriate participation of any of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- Exchange of personnel among the concerned laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement as well as the laboratories that cooperate on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the association agreement stipul@@ ated in Article 2 section 1 of this agreement , the parties are called an association agreement , referred to as &quot; Association Agreement &quot; between the Commission and the States and companies or persons following the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom contributes to the fact that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personal exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , &quot; concluded agreements on personnel exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the participation in J@@ ET , Switzerland is part of the timing of the present agreement of the present agreement to the Common Company J@@ ET whose statute accepts it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage you to confirm the agreement of the Community to these changes , and propose you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 . January 1978 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government , for example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage you to confirm the receipt of your letter today , with the following wording : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks offer a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement could be closed to the mechanism paid by credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of EUR 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all member countries &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some conditions are already mentioned below , for which the BI@@ Z would be prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every stand@@ by credit , the B@@ IS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions without a total of five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of the opening of the loans and on their event@@ ual extension , the BI@@ Z would charge a loan @-@ opening commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made prior to the exp@@ iry of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available by the B@@ IS , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the means of the bank , presumably three or six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conditions would correspond to those employed by the B@@ IS at the respective time on similar terms , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the BC@@ Z has to obtain the necessary funds itself on the market itself , the interest rate to be applied could reach a maximum that corresponds to the corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the B@@ IS could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks offer an appropriate application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the consent of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the consciousness that every generation of human beings manages the natural resources of the Earth for the coming generations , and is committed to ensuring that this legacy is preserved and where it is used to use it in a pru@@ dent manner ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic , dealing with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the determination of provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el - lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat from the community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - fresh or frozen chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual quantity : 20,000 tonnes , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the agreed quantities is not exceeded and / or cooled down in accordance with the usual bid forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the quotation form due to changes in technology and trade become possible , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the number 10 above to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community demands the safeguard clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the access of Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not affected by this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products covered by this agreement , to a rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new member states are admitted , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified by the number 2 according to the amount of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are stipul@@ ated in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which shall be taken into account under the number 5 above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be determined by the day of the Greek accession to the community to 23@@ ,000 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb industri@@ ally on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the execution of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are based on the traditional proportion of community trading with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular because the quantities of export licenses specified in this agreement are granted to the products listed under number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements to ensure the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned goods with origin in Argentina on the refer@@ ral of an export license specified by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way , that the position of a deposit for the distribution of import licenses for the question@@ able products cannot be dispens@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the provision stipul@@ ates that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community has been filed regularly for export licenses ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied , and works smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it regularly reviews the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the conditions on these markets including the conditions that are of importance to the goal called number 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee is concerned that the proper application of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tariff numbers according to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee deliber@@ ates all questions arising during the implementation of this agreement , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement shall be eff@@ ected without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties , under the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year will be fixed in relation to the total annual amount , and takes account of the seasonal nature of trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement are reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary to be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to share your government &apos;s approval , I would be grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ap@@ ologi@@ ze to confirm the receipt of your today &apos;s letter using the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the quantity that is actually executed exceeds the agreed quantities and is carried out according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of the products covered by this agreement , to a rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when new member states are admitted , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the amount specified by the number 2 according to the amount of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are stipul@@ ated in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty , which shall be taken into account under the number 5 above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would like to share your government &apos;s approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage you to share with you the consent of my government , with the content of your letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep market and export of beef and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and , especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , I have to propose the following agreement : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this agreement New Zealand is safegu@@ ar@@ ded for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat of access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand gets the assurance that the normal sale of its H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb di@@ ligent , is not affected by the application of the regulation in sympathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the amount that is actually executed is not exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above , are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments , or maintaining its position on the market of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a change in the quotation form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find a reasonable solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community demands the safeguard clause , it obli@@ ges itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion of products acquired by this agreement , to a high rate of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the amounts specified in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the import burdens for these new Member States are stipul@@ ated in accordance with the regulations of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall be taken into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion , stated in clause 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount stated in clause 2 will be determined by the day of the Greek accession to the Community to 2,@@ 45 500 tons of battle body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the ordinary sales of New Zealand and lamb industri@@ alists on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions to prevent the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of this objective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of she@@ ep@@ skin in the community without danger to market stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb can only be negotiated with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the amounts mentioned in clause 2 , in particular because there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions to ensure the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned goods with origin in New Zealand by the authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details for the application of this system are defined in such a way , that the position of a deposit for the distribution of import licenses for the question@@ able products cannot be dispens@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the provision stipul@@ ates that the competent authority of the New Zealand authority has been filed in regular intervals for the export licenses ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee is concerned that the agreement will be properly applied and will work smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee regularly reviews the tendency to the h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions stated in clause 7 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee is concerned that the proper application of the agreement is not impaired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned tariff numbers according to the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee shall discuss all issues arising during the implementation of the agreement , which shall be submitted to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the provisions of this agreement shall be eff@@ ected without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties , within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantity prescribed in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January , will be set in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community and , on the one hand , on the one hand , as well as for New Zealand &apos;s principal territory on the other hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement will take effect on October 20 , 1980 . it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a notice period of one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to propose , provided that your government agrees to the above , that this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a joint market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the quantities stated above , are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand cannot be prevented from taking advantage of new technological developments , or maintaining its position on the market of the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a change in the quotation form is possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 in order to find a reasonable solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb can only be negotiated with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I propose to propose that if your government agrees to the above , this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I encourage you to tell you that my government can agree to the above , and that your letter and response together form an agreement according to your proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import@@ ation of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure imp@@ ec@@ cable functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the quantity that is actually executed exceeds the agreed quantities and is carried out according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should a change in the quotation form due to changes in technology and trade become possible , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the number 10 above to find an appropriate solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the community demands the safeguard clause , it obli@@ ges itself to ensure that the access to Uruguay &apos;s access to the common market is not affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the membership of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount specified under number 2 according to the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb industri@@ ally on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the community meets provisions in order for the shipments of frozen meat to be under@@ mined due to the conduct of the Regulation on the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking into account the goals and regulations of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are based on the traditional proportion of community trading with these products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement , in particular because the quantities of export licenses specified in this agreement are granted for the products listed under number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary arrangements to ensure the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned goods with origin in Uruguay on the refer@@ ral of an export license specified by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the provision stipul@@ ates that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority in the competent authority of the community has been filed regularly for export licenses ; these data may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to destination country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community and , on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowing the fact that the contribution of the UN Environment Programme is done by the end of 1984 and this contribution as well as the voluntary contributions of governments not fully cover the cost of applying the employment plan of the E@@ MEP , so that provisions must be made to ensure long @-@ term financing after 1984 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) The financial obligations of the party , which termin@@ ates this protocol , continue until the termination is effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binding wording of this Protocol , which is equivalent to the English , French and Russian wording , is deposited at the Secretary General of the United Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; containers and in@@ fusion equipment are to be provided with a label in English and French , corresponding to the pattern contained in the plants 2 to 10 of this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human whole blood can only be sent in containers , where the temperature can be kept to 4 C to 6 C during the entire transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ che@@ ated and non @-@ toxic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to add the equipment required for in@@ fusion , as well as the solvents for dry preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human whole blood is taken away by a healthy person , and blood is mixed with an appropriate anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , insofar as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood flow is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ des through a closed , sterile valve system into a sterile container , in which the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant solution was gro@@ unded before steril@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completion of the bleeding , the bottle is immediately closed and to cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution must not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration may not drop 97 g per liter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined prior to the blood cells and serum , determining the R@@ h factor by examining the blood cells at a new sample of don@@ or blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as there are standardised or recommended procedures for blood group determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ h @-@ negative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to use if specific investigations have shown the non @-@ existence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood that has been replaced according to this Convention , should only be used for recipients of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is stored in a sterile , closed bottle from micro@@ organisms and permitted until its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only while the blood is allowed to cool at most 30 minutes , wher@@ eu@@ pon the blood is to cool again to 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ ness , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components can be present or may be partially removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ rit ) is to be indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all processes required for the production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the removal must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an artificial dil@@ uted solution has been added , its volume and composition can also be indicated on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is extracted through de@@ hydr@@ ation of the liquid , which is de@@ composed at centri@@ fu@@ ging or sedi@@ mentation of human full blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method , by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of the proteins is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a quantity of water that corresponds to the amount of liquid , from which one goes out in the production of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
protein concentration of the thus obtained solution must not be less than 45 g per litre and the solution must not show visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations , in which ( using a fresh juice sample ) , a dangerous content of I@@ beri@@ em@@ oly@@ sin or immune hem@@ me@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine has been established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood donations , the signs of bacterial contamination , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood volume of at least 10 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the risk of transferring I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation to hepatitis , it is possible to use mixtures containing no more than 12 donations or to apply other methods that are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the amount of liquid that is left in the production of plasma is to add the corresponding amount of water , and the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid produced from which it is manufactured ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) one sets 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so cl@@ ot@@ ting takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the incub@@ ator at 37 ° . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ hr drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight losses of more than 0.5 % may not occur in human dry plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry plasma is stored in a sterile , closed bottle in a sterile , closed bottle under exclusion of any micro@@ organisms and after the possibility of any moisture ; it is protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from human plasma proteins are preparations from the protein component , consisting of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma of the human mam@@ mot@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether the final product should be fluid or dry , the preparation must have been heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C for 10 hours after an appropriate stabili@@ zer in the final container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparations made from human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the final product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the Group is made of human Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein as a solution , it must have total protein concentration between 45 and 50 grams per liter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comparison measurements of viscosity and clou@@ ding as well as centri@@ fu@@ ging with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis which occur before and after heating to the solutions must not reveal any signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after heating to 57 C and six @-@ level shaking , the solution must be completely free of visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ) The testing tests with specific antibodies must show that in both preparations , only human plasma proteins are included ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
II ) the electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis caused by free @-@ floating particles in acceptable and suitable conditions must show that the protein fraction that possesses the mot@@ ility of the alb@@ um@@ in of normal human plasma is at least 95 % and in preparations from human plasma proteins at least 85 % of the protein &apos;s protein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and in fra@@ ctions of human plasma proteins , sodium concentration may not exceed 0,@@ 15 mo@@ l per liter solution or re @-@ produced Tro@@ k@@ screw preparation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the potassium concentration of the fac@@ tions from human plasma proteins may not exceed 2 m@@ mo@@ l per liter solution , or re @-@ produced dry preparation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pH @-@ value of each preparation must be based on a protein concentration of 10 g per liter with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l of potassium chlori@@ de per litre with a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ hr drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight losses over 0.5 % may not occur in dry preparations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry alb@@ um@@ in is stored in a sterile atmosphere or in a sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of moisture to store ; it is protected from light and at a temperature below 20 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solutions from human alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from human plasma proteins must be stored in sterile , closed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms . they are protected from light and at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the label on the container contains all information given on the appropriate socket , ( system 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is a preparation of plas@@ map@@ rot@@ ein , which was made from human , the antibody of normal adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applied manufacturing method must ensure that the final product is protected by the conditions described below , and does not transmit I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation @-@ hepatitis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the manufacturing method must ensure that the antibodies contained in the output product are concentrated in sufficient quantities in the final product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method is satisfactory for each final preparation in this respect , if in the output and in the final product antibodies for at least one virus and a bacterial tox@@ in are ti@@ tr@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during production , no anti@@ sep@@ tic or bacterial substance must be added ; in order to ensure the bacterial ster@@ ility and the stability of the final product , a suitable preserv@@ ative and a suitable stabil@@ iser can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end product is delivered as a solution , whose immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin level must be between 100 and 170 g per liter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; II ) The electro@@ ph@@ or@@ esis , represented by free @-@ floating particles , must show that at least 90 % of the protein mass have the mobility of the g@@ amma component of the glob@@ ul@@ ins of the normal human plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final solution must not show visible signs of precip@@ itation or clou@@ d@@ iness , neither before nor after a 7 @-@ day heating . furthermore , it is advisable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tests with the method of centri@@ fu@@ ging in the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge to determine , in which mass the product is broken down into components with a lower molecular weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pH @-@ value of the final solution must be based on a protein concentration of 10 g per liter with a solution containing 0.@@ 15 mo@@ l of potassium chlori@@ de per litre with a measuring temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.@@ 8 ± 0.@@ 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution from human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin is to be stored in sterile , closed containers under exclusion of micro@@ organisms ; it is protected from light and at a temperature of 4 to 6 C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins can be produced ; if an international standard exists , they are to be checked according to this standard and their efficiency is to be specified in International units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human anti @-@ po@@ x immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin has at least 500 international units of po@@ x antibodies per ml , which are determined by a neut@@ ron test on ch@@ orio @-@ all@@ an@@ to@@ i@@ der membranes or tissue culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human anti @-@ tet@@ anus immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin has at least 50 international units tet@@ anus @-@ tox@@ in per ml , which are determined by a neutr@@ alisation test on the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rest , the specific human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins have the conditions planned in Section 4 &quot; Nor@@ mal human immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the antibody content , the immune system can vary from 100 to 170 g per liter depending on the antibody level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the label has to indicate the efficiency in international units according to the corresponding international standard or reference preparation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human dry fi@@ brin@@ ogen is a dry preparation of the soluble part of the liquid human plasma , which is transformed by adding th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in into fi@@ br@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applied manufacturing method must ensure that the final product comp@@ utes the conditions described below , and the risk of transferring the is@@ no@@ cul@@ ation to a minimum is limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in of a solution human fi@@ br@@ ino@@ gens is attributed to the same concentration as fresh normal plasma , so the cl@@ ot@@ ting must occur outside of the double time required for the co@@ ag@@ ulation of normal fresh plasma with th@@ rom@@ bin@@ ic additive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the 24@@ hr drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm of mercury , weight losses of more than 0.5 % may not occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recovery , the final product must prove to be sterile after a suitable bacterial method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human fi@@ brin@@ ogen is stored in a sterile atmosphere or in a sterile , closed container under exclusion of micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of moisture to store ; it is protected from light and at the recommended temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the don@@ ors must be healthy and , in particular , be free of communic@@ able diseases according to the criteria which are resolved by human des@@ ic@@ ari@@ al plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cold precip@@ itation in the plastic bag , the product must not contain any organic solvents or other foreign substances in the freezer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting the parties all necessary measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances of human origin provided by the other parties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to guarantee this exemp@@ tion shall fall into the jurisdiction of the Community by which it was founded , which has the powers required for this purpose ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas it is necessary to implement the article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , the European Economic Community shall become a contracting party of the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Convention comes into effect for the community on the first day of the month , which follows the signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first day of the month comes into force , following the day when the last of the parties has deposited its acceptance certificate at the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) This Ad@@ ditional Protocol enters into force after two years after the date of acceptance , unless one of the parties has notified a objection against his entry into force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the member states of the Council of Europe , all Member States and the European Economic Community , each assumption or objection in terms of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol by Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General notes any action , notification or communication in connection with this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas Member States wish to support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in the procurement of re@@ agents for blood group determination , it is highly desirable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for blood group determination are subject to the requirements imposed by the Member States , and the necessary facil@@ itation and exceptions for their import shall be granted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this agreement , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood group determination and to determine blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every contracting party can restrict the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the determination of the blood group during the signing of this Convention , or in the consideration of its rati@@ fication , approval or accession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a notification made to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe , at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracting parties undertake to leave re@@ agents to the blood group determination against reimbur@@ sement of the costs of their extraction , preparation and transportation as well as the purchase price of other contracting parties , if they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are provided to other contracting parties only under the condition that no profit is associated with it that they are only used for medical purposes and are only supplied to positions designated by the governments involved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to the blood group determination shall be accompanied by a certificate , that they were made according to the regulations of the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protocol and its installation constitute an administrative agreement , which may be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the parties of the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties will take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents , provided by other contracting parties , to determine blood group determination of all input data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also meet all the necessary measures to ensure that these substances reach the recipient in Article 3 , quickly and in the shortest possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties submit to each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , a list of points authorised for the issu@@ ance of the certificate issued in Article 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Article 6 of the European Convention , these positions should be identical to the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin designated in Article 6 of the European Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe upon the signing of ; they can be signed by a party , without prior consent of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this agreement enters into effect one month after the day in which three members of the Council have signed it to Article 7 without the rati@@ fication or approval , or have rati@@ fied or approved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each member that this Convention is signed or rati@@ fied later without prior consent of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after its signing or the rati@@ fication of rati@@ fication or approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the members of the Council and the reti@@ ring states a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed it , or have rati@@ fied or approved the rati@@ fication ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every contracting party may termin@@ ate this convention , subject to a period of one year by indicating the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ ul@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the re@@ th@@ inning of the re@@ agent to be studied , the title is measured on double in a suitable medium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is the most reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the flow of blood circulation in the total volume .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood group determination International Standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of Internation@@ als per mg or ml ; and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The efficacy of re@@ agents to determine the blood group determination of most species is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ally , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te flow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title indicates the re@@ agent di@@ lution in the final mix within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic presence occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B will contain more than 256 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparison of the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in fluid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents , which is applied on the label , depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dry re@@ agent may only lose 0,5 mg of its weight if it is tested by further drying by phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des during a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , if the re@@ agent continues to provide the conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid , or re @-@ dissolved serum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or particles or visible particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the re@@ agents needed for the international exchange of blood @-@ group determination shall not be arti@@ ficially colored as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has reached a unified system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount must be so large in a container that may , if necessary , be used to perform the effectiveness tests described in this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer laboratory has written records on all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood group definition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proper rehear@@ s@@ als of all issued re@@ agents should be stored for a long time from the laboratory , until some likel@@ ihood can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents used for blood group determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintaining the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective component in three groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a black on white printed label in English and French can be attached to each individual container , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing liquid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the container contain : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . the quantity or quantity of liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishing liquid , in case of dried re@@ agents ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each consi@@ gn@@ ment shall be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention , according to the system to this protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group B , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of group A and AB , including the sub@@ group A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ A serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison preparations separately against floo@@ ding of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ A serum on an object carrier is mixed with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing out of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells which is required if the same experiment is performed with the again dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of the group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain B @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison preparations against the floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing out of B @-@ blood cells which is necessary if the same experiment is performed with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals of the group 0 that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ ous A and B or B ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no ag@@ glut@@ inu@@ ous A or B ; i.e. those of the group 0 .
it ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which generally are not ag@@ glut@@ inated by group B by anti @-@ A serum ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is parallel to the re @-@ sol@@ dered but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison preparations separately against floo@@ ding of A1 and A2 blood cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is parallel to the again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison preparations against a floo@@ ding of B @-@ blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the effectiveness of the serum may not be less than 64 international units per ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily det@@ ectable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the group A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hes of A1 and A2 blood cells is mixed so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be performed with the once dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparations of the anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard preparation of the same activity .
anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um is mixed onto an object carrier with a equal amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing out of B @-@ blood cells which is required if the same experiment is performed with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of each species can be one of two types , which are distinguished by the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olo@@ ous blood cells is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely &quot; , ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved by presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as beef alb@@ um@@ in or with the aid of other special methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; Ser@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells that are em@@ med in their own serum or plasma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may possibly change if International standard preparations are available ( i ) anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , immun@@ ised by the tigen D of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 opposite C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; complete &quot; anti @-@ D serum is parallel to the dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the complete Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) serum or a corresponding comparative prevention against C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a reaction with all red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , the serum should react with blood cells which contain do @-@ an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , which are intended for use of object carriers according to the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , immun@@ ised by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ser@@ a are therefore only specific for the C an@@ tigen , if the tested blood cells are in@@ hibited in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the title of anti @-@ C ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
anti @-@ C Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons , immun@@ ised by the tigen E of the R@@ h system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 versus C@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and in no form anti @-@ D ) must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds .
sera of the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and the specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals or can be produced by mixing anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time among the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a serum is determined for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period should not be smaller than in the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of the group A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB , including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A@@ 2@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

anti @-@ A serum on an object carrier is mixed with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % flus@@ hing out of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A@@ 2@@ B blood cells which is required if the same experiment is performed with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group ser@@ ums or a standard drug of the same amount of avi@@ dity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals , which can be immune to red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ates human red blood cells which contain B @-@ an@@ tigen that is called those of blood groups B and AB ; it does not contain any human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ tigen which is called those of blood groups 0 and A .
an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ sol@@ dered but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or a corresponding comparison preparations with an in@@ fusion of blood cells of the group B ( 1 ) .
anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of 5@@ - to 10 % flus@@ hing out of B @-@ blood cells which is necessary if the same attempt is performed with the re@@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group ser@@ ums or with a standard prepar@@ ate of the same avi@@ dity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ Ser@@ um , for use in blood group ser@@ ology , must contain ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating antibodies against complementary factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is extracted from the blood of animals , which are immun@@ ised by injection of human serum proteins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used by the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , so there are no un@@ loaded human red blood cells in@@ different to which blood group they belong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an anti @-@ human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ serum has to cause a strong ag@@ glut@@ ination of the red blood cells in the supplied form or on the label indicated on the label when the ti@@ tr@@ ation with D @-@ positive blood cells is performed after the &quot; alb@@ um@@ in @-@ Re@@ placement &quot; method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same di@@ lution it is necessary to ag@@ glut@@ inate the K @-@ positive human red blood cells , which are carefully selected by the weak anti @-@ antibody antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same way or another on the label , it must also ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells that are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak complementary bin@@ ders in complete anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for clinical use , the plaque should be det@@ ectable with all types of in@@ complete antibodies using a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extrac@@ ting seeds or other parts of a suitable plant and , if necessary , cleaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to guarantee this exemp@@ tion shall fall into the jurisdiction of the Community by which it was founded , which has the powers required for this purpose ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point onwards , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming a contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe notified the member states of the Council of Europe , all Member States and the European Economic Community , each assumption or objection in terms of Article 2 and the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol by Article 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the Joint Declaration , adopted by the ministers of the EF@@ TA Countries and the Member States of the Community as well as from the Commission of the European Communities in Luxembourg on 9 April 1984 , in particular with regard to simpli@@ fication of the regulations and the rules of origin , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in THE sense that the community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the Programme of Action on 1 January 1988 , in the internal community of goods a uniform management plan has to be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in THE sense that it is appropriate to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular through the introduction of a single administration paper ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in THE statement that this Agreement may not be interpreted as possible , that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties from their obligations arising from other international agreements - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this convention , measures are set to simplify the transportation of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries and for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligations associated with the transport of goods between the contracting parties are gro@@ unded by means of a uni@@ formity , for which prints are to be used in App@@ endi@@ x I to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the case , the template serves as an application or paper to export , to the shipping method or to import . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to be requested explicitly in accordance with the legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be ensured with the sole use of the uni@@ formity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to be demanded by the participants , so that they may come upon request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not prevent the parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , in view of further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be submitted to the customs office and the application for these goods cannot be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of incomplete registration can be admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in such cases , an application must be submitted subsequently , with the consent of the relevant authorities for a periodi@@ c collection registration , within the deadline specified by these authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use business station@@ aries instead of the filing fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the agreement template is used , so the parties concerned with the consent of the relevant authorities will be able to apply common lists to the filing and import papers in the commercial paper in which the goods are described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to a further simpli@@ fication of the responsibility for their entire goods traffic , or for sub @-@ areas ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - in case of consi@@ gn@@ ments that include several types of goods , for the provision of the prob@@ abilities in the shipping method , instead of using the supplementary sheets to the unit paper ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - allow applications to be created by public or private data processing facilities , according to the conditions specified by the relevant authorities ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - allow the competent authorities to enter the data required for the provision of the relevant measures in their data processing systems for the treatment of applications , and possibly without giving a written notification ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - allow the competent authorities to verify that the delivery , shipment or import registration is either issued by a single template or , if such a paper is not created , through the input of the data into the data processing system ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Fac@@ il@@ itation , adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the way of a resolution in accordance with Article 11 paragraph 3 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of goods required for export , shipping and import of goods shall be settled in App@@ endi@@ x II to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the preliminary prints specified in the app@@ endi@@ x I , are to be found in App@@ endi@@ x III to this Convention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The registration is authorised in one of the official languages of the contracting parties , authorised by the competent authorities of the country in which the responsibilities for export or shipping are met . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country or transit country may require a translation of the registration into the official language or one of the official languages of this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) Up@@ coming from paragraph 1 , registration is always to be realized in one of the official languages of the import country , if they occur in this country using other copies of the registration or delivery country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the application examples for each individual part of a period of goods between the contracting parties , where necessary to be included in one of the following sections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) The claim of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the provisions for the export and the shipment process can be reduced to one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cases of article 7 , the relevant authorities will be able to agree to the extent that the information contained in the individual sections of the application must be in agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 1 ) To ensure a smooth exchange of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the discovery of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements the customs authorities of these countries ask for one another or if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be completely or partially denied or denied , if the requested country would imp@@ air its security , public order or other essential interests or violate a business , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the respective decision and its grounds for the seeking country must be communicated in@@ correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
