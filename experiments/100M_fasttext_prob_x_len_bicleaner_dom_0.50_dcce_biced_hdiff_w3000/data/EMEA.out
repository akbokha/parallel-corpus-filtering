&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained how the Medic@@ ines Committee ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package position ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1@@ mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e.g. whir@@ l@@ wind thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder where patients may have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) with periods of normal mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , if the oral intake of the drug is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both cases , the solution can be used to inhal@@ e or melt tablets in patients with difficulty preparing tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this affects the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly a &quot; partial ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , however , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alizing the activity of the brain , reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent the onset of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased anxiety , over a period of two hours compared to a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to increased un@@ rest led by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was studied using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets , and the solution to intake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies involving the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , significantly increased the symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo , and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( di@@ zz@@ iness ) , fatigue , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from severe to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episodes and in those the man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in case of oral therapy are predomin@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission approved the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering the greater sensitivity to these patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior is related to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorder and was reported in some cases after initiation or change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased suicide rate with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics in patients with bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , hy@@ po@@ di@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y have signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esia , consider to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate m@@ ns or have unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , have to be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in one of these studies , there was a study of fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , weight gain is observed in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , where weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution must be exercised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isi@@ ers can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one considers the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y , potential benefits should predomin@@ ate for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the metering of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height prior to the initiation of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 administered together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate rise in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies of the animal , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks performed in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ sp@@ ici@@ in therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under hal@@ i@@ dol treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) generally mom@@ entary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials and since the launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with valued doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole exhibits high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
the posit@@ ron @-@ emission @-@ tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d with a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands on a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor @-@ lig@@ and on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hal@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to the study medication , similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic traits , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients suffering from symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l versus placebo superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar response , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ sis of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole with extensive metabol@@ isi@@ ers over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isi@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in volunteers with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A and B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on the safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the recommended maximum dose in humans ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the study , are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle flight state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties using anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a placebo superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents including AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 administered together with AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate rise in the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol@@ - concentrations .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
a total weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) was measured in a relative bio @-@ availability study in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to healthy subjects .
99 addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and begin with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to boost the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. Del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle in the direction of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0,@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on individual clinical status , taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute treatment ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y tablets , AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y weld tablets or AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions in patients with a@@ gi@@ ti@@ ghtness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently than caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injec@@ tions are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , hy@@ po@@ di@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical manifestations of m@@ ns are high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ia , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight gain is generally associated with schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia based on com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties using anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the intra@@ muscular method used in healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dosage ) and the same time as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the H@@ 2 ant@@ ag@@ onist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resor@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically un@@ relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isi@@ ers can result in the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may have similar effects and therefore similar dosage reductions should be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the metering of AB@@ I@@ LI@@ F@@ Y should be lifted to the dose height prior to the initiation of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg of dose ) were intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared with the after all@@ some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following adverse events were commonly reported in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pr@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1.000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a placebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a comparison between the patient populations under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters showed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increases in CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) in general and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic in general were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .

in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and as@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders the Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in comparison to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from the bas@@ eline at the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo and 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gra@@ vation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined because of a reduced number of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a hal@@ i@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 was the share of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication , similar to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in the rate of return which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
a total weight increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca . 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) versus the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder with or without psych@@ otic symptoms that sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded a superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ an@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo considering the prevention of a bi@@ polar response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the dosage of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar to the two form@@ ulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l &apos;s injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which were 15 or 5 times over the maximum human therapeu@@ tical exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ related concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) about the maximum humane treatment of 30 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ level toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase of adren@@ al @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after doses , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ times of the middle @-@ of @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 4@@ 60 women participated in metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters earlier had obtained an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional treatment with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in the efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators , Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ es in the blood before the start of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines there must not be given to other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients , where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ately &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4 and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to lack of adequate data for safety and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ cular formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have considerably different pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment will be initiated and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients , no further Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increase back to &gt; 1,5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number is again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method , during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised , during and up to six months after treatment no child is given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; male patients should be advised about a sperm count prior to treatment , as through treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane there is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ ils and the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects that appeared in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most eye @-@ catching important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burning , dri@@ er mouth , pain in the lower abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pain in the thor@@ ax , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , pain in the skel@@ etal muscles , pain in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite , related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events was established . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules agent that promotes the fusion of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabilization leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network that is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ otheli@@ al cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in feeds the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ otheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and occurs because of the alb@@ um@@ bin@@ der protein SP@@ ARC ( associated protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the tumor area .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two random@@ ized un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized phase III comparative study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given a dose of 175 mg / m2 in an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer in 63 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this multi @-@ centric study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer which received a 3 @-@ week mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ; either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 and in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
9 The results for the overall response rate and time until progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are described below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to the sound of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
exposure to active substance ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration was performed in a multi@@ phase manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 , and the high distribution volume points to an extensive extra@@ ocular distribution and / or connection of the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute injection of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) than according to a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily met@@ abo@@ lized to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α @-@ 3 &quot; p di@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minutes in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose of 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chemical and physical stability was proven at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box , and protected from light light over 8 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ cancer drug and as with other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ pier@@ cing bottle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the pier@@ cing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good use of the solid material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the pier@@ cing bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted , until a full suspension of the powder is done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if precip@@ itation or tin@@ ting is visible , the pier@@ cing bottle has to be inver@@ ted gently in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ boarding before applying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml Sus@@ pension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; member states must ensure that the owner is responsible for placing the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to market launch : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging supplement . • With un@@ equi@@ vocal representation of the correct application of the product , cold boxes for transport through the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ blood test values , in which a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible in connection with blood trans@@ fusion and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , for which the medicine is indicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided they have received appropriate guidance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell produced by a gene ( DNA ) , capable of forming epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company presented the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin have been studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients treated on Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as in those patients who continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to this , the patients who continued receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ inging mig@@ ra@@ ine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered thereby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence , the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company that manufactures Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission approved Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG , a permit for the placing of Ab@@ se@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate in case of planned larger surgical procedures that require a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be used to participate in aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rise in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in a patient or under the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 25 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest recommended dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b values ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b values ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by means of intraven@@ ous application if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an@@ emia symptoms and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and disease condition is required by the physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be used to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest recommended dose , which is required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number of ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l per week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in rise &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l rise above the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if following 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
on the other hand the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 40.000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the initial value is an indication of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy unlikely and the treatment should be cancelled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ser@@ tion is required , should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the iron substitution should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme began to provide large iron reserves prior to the beginning of the Ab@@ se@@ amed therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the medicine in the circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who develop under treatment with some er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia or PR@@ CA ) should not receive an Ab@@ se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ y ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ ian known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients with a severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of car@@ ols or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stop@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic cy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a loss of activity is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity for sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in case of maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ genic agents ( ESA ) were given a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit to the use of epo@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in case of maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for tumour patients with chemotherapy , an 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who need to be trans@@ acted ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a h@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the goal of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision for applying re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment , taking into account the specific clinical context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if possible , before the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients undergoing a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , particularly with a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an increased risk for post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can not be excluded when treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting age of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in several controlled trials , for epo@@ et@@ ine , it was not proven that patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F for hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , pulmon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease can occur after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate part , identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of native patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ blast ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 Non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es , 23 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1895 patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast carcin@@ omas , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors , and 4@@ 78 other ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
survival and progression were studied in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and in case of controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy subjects and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 . in veter@@ inary studies with approximately 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced form of body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these reports are based on in vitro fer@@ til@@ isation with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store for a maximum of 3 days outside the refrigerator and not over 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are equipped with graduation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a printed label , so that , if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in treating patients with the above indications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 The recommended dose is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 In patients with chronic kidney failure , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in case of maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will conduct regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into consideration and treated before the onset of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rarely , er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y after mon@@ or@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y , it will break down your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed needs to be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in bin@@ ds the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of dying could be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of elevated or increasing potassium reflections , your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are again in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney weak@@ ening and clin@@ ically revealed coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion mark by inadequate heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney disease ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly so as to keep the risk of a blood c@@ rop@@ p formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully concerning the benefits derived from treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pulmon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumour under certain circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is imminent , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medications , or if it is not prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may require certain blood tests to measure the blood level of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) are used to build the immune system ( e.g. for cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine is effective and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are well set , you get regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , distributed over two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to squ@@ ir@@ m yourself among the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart attacks , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( squee@@ ze ede@@ ma ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling , and acceler@@ ating pulse were reported in rare cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special warnings when applying se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after repeated blood donations , it may - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - may result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of bleeding after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) when your starting point is too high
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you , or if you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a sy@@ ringe has been taken from the refrigerator and has reached room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ tures ( frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a slight trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like during the fall ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of Kno@@ x , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injec@@ ting into a muscle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after applying A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to treat the disease , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first study included nearly 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate content in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most side effects of A@@ cla@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ la@@ sta must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc @-@ ron@@ ic acid , or any other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides clarification material for doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis as well as the similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission approved Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ la@@ sta across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • A contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When treating on medical or nursing help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • for men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an IV in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of A@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a treatment by Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients receiving treatment ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the application of A@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the first A@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of A@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) in patients with a cre@@ atine @-@ clearing &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient group is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data for safety and efficacy is lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience exists for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ emia is to be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia is likely to occur within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to ensure adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the application of A@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be induced by applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who require dental procedures , no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after applying A@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) are listed in table 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
kidney Dys@@ function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic was associated with kidney function disorders that expressed itself as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ atine clearing ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis for over three years compared between the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of application was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta vs 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of the laboratory findings the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate levels of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administered by A@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial , local reactions to the in@@ fusion position , such as redness , swelling and / or pain were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region was generally treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , especially in the jaw region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area at a patient with A@@ la@@ sta and in a patient treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of an over@@ dose leading to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ emia , calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been demonstrated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ dog ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or several new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra , hip and dist@@ al radius at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip increased by 6.@@ 0 % , the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ dog by 5.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bone hist@@ ology : for 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 82 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken out of the basin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ T ) analysis showed an increase in the tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone volume and the retention of tr@@ ab@@ ecular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 12 months , the treatment was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total @-@ mortality rate was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment raised BM@@ D on the total th@@ igh and Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als at all times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 24 months compared to placebo , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % in total and by 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once @-@ yearly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate compared to the weekly administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate compared to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline did not lie down .
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta was studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when recording into the study ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg to@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months , was demonstrated in two six months of comparison studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study could maintain the therapeutic response in 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate compared with 71 of those treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate in the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes permanent in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients revealed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be a dose @-@ independent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ to 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination time t ½ g 14@@ 6 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early phases of distribution ( α and β , with the above t ½ values ) represent probably the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total body @-@ clearing amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an extension of the fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the ci@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ lized substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized by humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or mis@@ versi@@ bly and metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient populations ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of the ci@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ) and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate ren@@ al dysfunction until a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require any dose adaptation of the ci@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only limited , no statements are possible for this population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest not let@@ al acting intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C are 6 times the recommended humane @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was determined in rats by 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals ( a cum@@ ulative dose corresponding to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure relative to AU@@ C ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that adequately exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including the Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most frequent finding of studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Metap@@ hysi@@ se of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at rats , one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skeleton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of reduced serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage period after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ la@@ sta is packaged as a pack containing a bottle as a packing unit or as a bundle pack consisting of 5 packs , each containing one bottle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens , which are formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass which is observed in men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ la@@ sta works by normal@@ ising the bone reconstruction , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus l@@ ends strength to the bone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use A@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines , even if they are not prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know whether you are taking drugs , known from those known to the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta along with food and drinks , you are concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions sufficient liquid before and after treatment with A@@ la@@ sta take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have broken the hips recently , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the usual dose is 5 mg , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as A@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need a further dose after a year or longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to follow these instructions carefully , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low after in@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ la@@ sta can work longer than one year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you missed the administration of A@@ la@@ sta , you immediately get in touch with your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before stopping the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta Falls , please consider your next doctor &apos;s date and discuss it with your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , because of other diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allergic reactions including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves , angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) have been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not listed in this utility information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions of the application . normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C are not exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to make the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before and after the administration of A@@ la@@ sta , patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic les@@ ions develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the application of A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended prior to the in@@ fusion of A@@ la@@ sta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package position ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or higher ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there were four studies carried out in over 7 000 patients , in which A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was used as a supporting agent for setting up smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the studies on setting up smoking show no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A was difficult to assess in this field of application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A ? it The most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A which were observed during trials ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea ) and infections of upper respiratory tract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may also be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause suicide thanks to a small minority of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
caution is recommended when applying A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for applying to HI@@ V@@ - infection ) or th@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the effectiveness of A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A regarding weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this medicine is used in patients suffering from health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by providing treatment packages for patients and doctors ) , and the AR@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a supplement to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or obes@@ e patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ COMP@@ LI@@ A is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to absence of data , effectiveness and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes associated with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts with up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefits of treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in patients who - besides the obesity , have no recognis@@ able risks , can occur depres@@ sive reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relatives or other relatives ( relatives or others ) have to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new appearance of such symptoms , and to immediately get medical advice when these symptoms occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• El@@ der patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been demonstrated adequately .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the un@@ desirable effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients , which were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metabolic diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a comparative study , in which a limited number of individuals were given dispos@@ able inputs of up to 300 mg , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an simultaneously existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .

under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg an average tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with an obes@@ e and with previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) the absolute change of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ( with a initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was -@@ 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 in placebo
the percentage of patients receiving a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5.3 Pres@@ ent clinical data for the safety of the following unwanted effects , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which were observed in animals after exposure to the human therapeutic area , were considered possibly relevant for clinical application : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some cases , however , not in all cases , the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions with process @-@ related stress appears to be connected with the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant so no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Health Organization Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which has been explained how the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not shown . • It can be used together with another diabetes treatment ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be used in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be set satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes much better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; in addition , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either an account or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients enrolled in addition to insulin , reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who additionally took placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain , and hy@@ po@@ dies@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos should neither be applied to patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis - acid levels - in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit for the promotion of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symp@@ tom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when used in combination with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this study showed an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with elevated initial liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are as soon as possible to control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient develops symptoms associated with h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enz@@ ym@@ atic values are to be checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision as to whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led by the clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters have been passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparing controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ cavity or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ ac@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported to a decrease in visual acuity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct correlation between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report on disturbances of vision ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient desires pregnancy or if this occurs , the treatment should be removed ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in and war@@ far@@ in and phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel block@@ ers and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a lowering of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common &gt; 1 / 100 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 ; occasional &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare ( not valuable from this data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents performed three times the upper limit of the normal range equally frequently as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with previously advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than under placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported on heart failure at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which leads to increased insulin sensitivity of liver and fat and skel@@ etal cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ inst@@ ation in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ lu@@ ci@@ dal as a mon@@ otherapy was carried out over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficiently adjusted with insulin in spite of three months of optimization , were random@@ ised to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the output values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 week examination of type 2 diab@@ etics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ kia reduced total plastic gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on while values were reduced in met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ dic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post den@@ ounce increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular end study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups that received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo for over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ alter@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually reach 2 hours after application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in about thre@@ ef@@ old of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interaction studies , it could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after oral application of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average plasma eli@@ oration period of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and all of the active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the mother substance are similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conver@@ ged after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um were induced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ ac@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy for met@@ form@@ in were examined with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials over one year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent compared to the output values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved the post den@@ ounce increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as on h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the study has missed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which is a combination of the total mortal , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , coron@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and retinal re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and bear on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients receiving the comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , but also improved post @-@ den@@ ounced tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin and type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels , indicating that blood sugar levels were lowered similar to other human insulin levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package position ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane were predomin@@ ant in the treatment of diabetes in relation to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to permit Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane inver@@ ters throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice a day , if a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly , for example through intensified insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in the dose required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 Un@@ less hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diab@@ et@@ otherapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to un@@ consciousness and / or var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , and may end with temporary or permanent disorders of the brain function and even death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diseases of the nervous system - Peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar levels , however , can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diseases of the skin and the abdominal tissue of gel - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy An the injection site may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy if failed to change the pun@@ cture points within the injection range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) during insulin therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflammatory responses symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , respiratory problems , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and impotence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diab@@ etics should therefore always be treated with glucose , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a wei@@ ghted auxiliary person or given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum amount is reached within 2 to 8 hours , and the total length of the operation is up to 24 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products , with faster or delayed resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended , after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane bottle was taken out of the refrigerator - to let the temperature of the insulin rise at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for the first use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always ask for other drugs taken by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 12 As well as hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diab@@ etic therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and am@@ ni@@ otic death in uter@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 13 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar levels , however , can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the terminal half @-@ life ( t ½ ) is therefore rather a measure of resor@@ ption than a measure of the elimination per se of insulin from the plasma ( insulin has a t ½ of only a few minutes in the blood@@ stream ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended , after the Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane bottle was taken out of the refrigerator - to let the temperature of the insulin rise at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the instructions for the first use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement of blood sugar levels , however , can be associated with a temporary worsen@@ ing of diab@@ etic retin@@ opathy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

cartridges may only be used together with products compatible with them and ensure a safe and effective cartridge function .
it is recommended - after Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane Pen@@ fill was taken out of the refrigerator - to let the temperature of the insulin rise at room temperature ( not over 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ pen@@ ded according to the operating instructions for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than with their previous insulin .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the number on the closing cap directly next to the dosing mark • Record the highest number you have set on the press stud • Add the two numbers to get the set dose , just turn the cap forwards or backwards until you have adjusted the correct number of units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , insulin is out of the injection needle and the prescribed dose will not be correct • If you have tried to stop a dose of more than 78 units , follow the following steps : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then take the cap out and set it up again , that the 0 of the dosage brand is opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin , human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of quickly acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , this can be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions to the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma can occur at the injection site ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per month , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first treatment months , rheum@@ atic attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients receive even more medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplantation , as it was not examined for these groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used to treat hyper@@ tro@@ phy ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients , whose ur@@ inary acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once received 120 mg at the last three measurements showed a ur@@ inary acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 13@@ 4 patients under placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) arrived at the conclusion that A@@ den@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ an@@ ium deposits ( including a medical record known or present in the medical history , and / or arthritis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the serum levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ s / l ) , a dose increase can be considered to AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children and adolescents If there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organ transplantation Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other drugs in urine , a acute plaster attack may occur during the treatment , because the lowering of serum concentration levels may first mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it occurs in ur@@ inary tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver dysfunction were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and in the course of the course ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at test subjects , the simultaneous gift of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ ac@@ ic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) side effects that could be related to the medicine and reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In the clinical trials there were no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 Open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated in 90@@ 6 patients up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the events related during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 , either at all or with a lower frequency : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , ha@@ sten , short@@ ness , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , skin les@@ ions , erectile dysfunction , erectile dysfunction , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in number of white blood cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in humans , the effect mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ ism and is produced as part of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent and not Pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ tro@@ phy and g@@ out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
placebo ( n = 13@@ 4 ) ; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x a day ( n = 26@@ 9 ) ; AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x a day ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ ment value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x a day ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of serum concentration on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and continued throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ ment values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.@@ 0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x a day .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function ent@@ ang@@ lement The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney dysfunction ( i.e. h ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum concentration of serum , regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with serum concentration concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl em 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 extension study showed that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a pla@@ inti@@ ff ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was associated with a reduction in the cone size , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ amma k@@ not until month 24 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased SH@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 to 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 -@@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum concentrations as long as it was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
distribution The apparent flow @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed predominantly by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking a dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 30 % ) and its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average total AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ y / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13,@@ 2 μ y / ml in the group with severe kidney end@@ ys@@ function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 liver dysfunction after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification A ) or intermediate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction did not significantly change the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis and mut@@ agen@@ esis in male rats a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ ination tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin St@@ ones in the over@@ d@@ osed group with about 11 times the exposure to humans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these findings are seen as a result of specific Pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition , and considered not relevant for clinical application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic expos@@ ures , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which was associated with lowering the up@@ scale performance and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which were about the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about 13 times the human@@ istic exposure yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine . * * In the clinical trials there were no serious r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Open long @-@ term extension studies have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of the authorization for the placing of the drug has to make sure that a drug vig@@ il@@ ance system is described as in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , before the drug is brought into circulation , and is available as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline , an updated R@@ MP is to be presented with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) according to the CH@@ MP Guid@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on the safety data , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ ization , on request of E@@ MEA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some people , the ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation will be prevented and in this way a reduction of discomfort is achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active agent F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before starting with taking this medicine if you have a heart weakness or suffer from another heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ inary acid concentration in a result of a cancer or Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital condition in which too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood is located ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a plaster attack at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat feeling and joint swelling ) , wait until the tox@@ in fall off before you begin treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines if necessary , to prevent the attack or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medications , or if it is not prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is particularly important that you will be able to inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking medicine / using one of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C might occur and your doctor may possibly want to consider necessary measures . • Activ@@ ation ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood th@@ inning in heart disease )
no studies have been carried out on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the per@@ ver@@ ability and the ability to operate machinery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , the individual week@@ days are printed so that you can check whether you have taken a tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have un@@ intentionally taken over@@ dose , consult your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , get it as soon as possible unless the next intake is imminent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ab@@ ort the intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , your ur@@ inary acid concentration may increase , and your symptoms can wor@@ sen because new urine crystals can form in your joints and kidneys as well as their surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frequent side effects ( more than 1 of 100 treated , but less than 1 of 10 treatments ) : • St@@ unning liver tests • diar@@ rhe@@ a • headache • rash • nausea &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk for low vitamin D levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient should not lie until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separately used in pharmaceuticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase in vitamin D levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company proposes that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ ature ( muscles , bones or joints ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , di@@ ar@@ rhe@@ a ( intestinal disorders ) , infl@@ amed abdom@@ en ( infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as acid b@@ ump@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE must not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. a permit for the promotion of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following indications are to be followed precisely , to reduce the risk of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed after rising the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or break the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the doctor should therefore be attentive to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia or pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ sp@@ ear@@ al pain or new or wor@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and to get medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 The risk of serious o@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine properly , and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no elevated risk was detected ( after market introduction ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , some of which were severe and associated with complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw is usually reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ o@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data available to indicate whether a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment in patients who require a ortho@@ sis procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning with each patient , based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week@@ day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated adequately prior to treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although specific interaction studies were not performed , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by breast@@ feeding women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but also with oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless the serum @-@ calcium decreased to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at following an oral over@@ dose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main effect of 1.9 D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D@@ 3 is the increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate , as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 3@@ 70 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multi @-@ center study of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in phase III studies , the middle asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day amounted to 8.@@ 8 % on the verteb@@ ral column , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the trough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 3.2 % compared to placebo 6,@@ 2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering one or more verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of verteb@@ ral and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to maintain ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this study , the daily application of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resor@@ ption of an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fast and two hours before receiving a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase of 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 9 distribution trials in rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is disper@@ sed temporarily after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearing of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and the systemic clearing is not 200 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of radio@@ actively prominent vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy volunteers , mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the barrels after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal experiments is also reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tablets are available as rectangular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 270 &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Adv@@ agra@@ f , adult patients are administered to which a kidney or liver was transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the gra@@ ft was rejected after a treatment period of one year ( for example , examining how often a re @-@ organ transplantation or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , further studies in 119 patients with kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver tran@@ spl@@ ant were performed and investigated how an an@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tre@@ mor , headache , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diabetes , increased blood glucose levels , hypertension ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ d antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time using Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f , as the drug dose or the dose of the medicine taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap top with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only doctors , who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of tran@@ spl@@ ant patients , should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosing ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a consequence of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adap@@ tations must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level provisions ( see below )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirror should be checked before switching over and over two weeks after the transition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Day 4 , systemic exposure was compared with both kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ lies are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ ting under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night planning phase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the ingredient can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can recommendations - kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily application in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can later be required since the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabil@@ isation of the patient after transplantation .
can recommendations - liver tran@@ spl@@ ant pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily application in the morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage recommendation - The conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted from twice daily dosing of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in the case of kidney and liver tran@@ spl@@ ant must begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart tran@@ spl@@ ant In adult patients , which are converted to Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once daily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other gra@@ ft receivers Al@@ though there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in pulmon@@ ary and pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 3@@ mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose adaptation in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the as@@ pi@@ red area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum incre@@ mental levels , a calculation of the urine volume ) is recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f at the transition from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases , taking full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low level during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ isation , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or simultaneous use of substances that could alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus thorou@@ gh@@ bred can be controlled ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the lower level does not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical practice , the talks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the first time after liver tran@@ spl@@ ant usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and adren@@ al transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which can occur in a series of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Under@@ - or Over@@ exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosing ; con@@ stell@@ ations of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the tight control of a physician experienced in tran@@ spl@@ ant ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ ant@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers and tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording Advent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to possible interactions , which may result in lowering the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements , the cur@@ rant &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ omy@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid retention and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of sun protection with a high protection factor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , con@@ vul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ tose intoler@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies , known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor , monitor and monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level while applying the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels resulted mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly do@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which can be met@@ abo@@ lized by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect metabolism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ances of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly careful to take precau@@ tionary measures regarding contrac@@ eption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearing of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ on and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of a small number of gra@@ fts in tran@@ spl@@ ant patients do not indicate that , in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of un@@ desirable events is due to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible adverse effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( particularly with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cal@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ si@@ va is often difficult to determine because of the patient &apos;s health and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following the side effects are mentioned in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases How well @-@ known for other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high bonding to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should be medi@@ ated through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duc@@ tions in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymph@@ oma genes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus op@@ presses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the T cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 confirmed acu@@ ations were 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
the survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women and 11 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm were 24 ( 5 women and 19 men ) .
the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant receivers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy and safety of Pro@@ gra@@ f , C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and Adv@@ agra@@ f , in combination with Basili@@ xi@@ mab , antibody production , MM@@ F and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , compared to 6@@ 38 de nov@@ o kidney tran@@ spl@@ ant recipients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death and transplantation loss ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ agra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 15.@@ 1 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) .
the difference of treatment was -@@ 3.@@ 0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and -@@ 1.9 % ( Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( -@@ 8.@@ 9 % ; 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) were killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus following primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 175 treatment transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent multi@@ center study involving oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was reported more than 110 patients receiving either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chronic tran@@ spl@@ ant , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was also observed in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis in comparison to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0,@@ 0@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients that were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ ting occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.@@ 3 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.@@ 3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pancre@@ as tran@@ spl@@ ant A multi @-@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation based on a random@@ ised method Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the as@@ pi@@ red vision of 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color@@ ec@@ tal tran@@ spl@@ ant The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after oral transplantation showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests that Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metabol@@ ised before ex@@ cre@@ tion , and ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done through bile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f in patients with stable patients ( once daily ) compared to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low level during the first two weeks following tran@@ spl@@ ant , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid retention and ede@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
28 confirmed acu@@ ations were 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may not rely on the control of a vehicle or operate tools or machines , if you feel di@@ zzy or sleep@@ y after taking part in Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important information on certain other constitu@@ ents of Adv@@ agra@@ f Please note Adv@@ agra@@ f only after consultation with your doctor , if you are aware that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure you always receive the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus medicine if you redeem your prescription , unless your specialist has expressly agreed to change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for your doctor to determine the correct dose and be able to adjust from time to time , he must then regularly conduct blood tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a greater amount of Adv@@ agra@@ f than you should accidentally take a larger amount of Adv@@ agra@@ f , you immediately seek to contact your doctor or the emergency department of the nearest hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance is used to treat and prevent ble@@ ed@@ ings in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II @-@ related , inn@@ ate blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage and frequency of the application is based on whether Adv@@ ance is used for the treatment of bleeding , or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ots problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced according to a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which em@@ powers it to the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance is a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any type of animal or animal origin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three additional studies to patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the main study , the efficacy of Adv@@ ance in the prevention of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges was assessed in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ sis with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively &quot; good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ance ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ance must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the Company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing of lawyers in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and extent of the bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients less than 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients less than 6 years ) , until the risk is over for the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the treatment course , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose and the frequency of injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to factor VI@@ II , individual patients may differ in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rate of application should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation does not occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AD@@ R@@ s occurring in the majority of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ der was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient value on the 15 postoperative day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials involving A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed difficult to moderate @-@ severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , no 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and mild to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) found a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune response of patients to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and an ongoing peak of anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene in the human body , usually contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub @-@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the assessment of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors has advantages for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company did not note the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective ingredients will be released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults and adolescents aged 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and stop as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended , because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main efficacy levels were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms , which were reported by patients before the onset of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients reported that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze had a decrease of 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when only the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , oral dr@@ y@@ ness , di@@ zz@@ iness , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be used in patients who suffer from a con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival glau@@ com@@ as , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hypertension ) or a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP Europe European Commission approval for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed by the whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or chew@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the lack of data , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used for children under the age of 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the symptoms fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days , since long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , er@@ y@@ dro@@ phr@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , aph@@ rodi@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective , and the data is not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for the dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to make appropriate recommendations for dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients must be informed that the treatment in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythms , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of the head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck sob@@ bing or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce their extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions , or alterations in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor testing no significant differences could be observed between the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether he was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing , neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not reveal any increase in the frequency of mal@@ formations compared to the frequency of the normal population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a presum@@ ption that may lead to impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ ne@@ a , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible Latvian processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , anxiety , terri@@ fied Mik@@ tion , muscular weakness , increased muscle tension , euph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , visual distur@@ b@@ ance and hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely for children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ drying , pup@@ il rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include both the hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion of the P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 participating in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than in mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city , the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ ol tablets showed no significant differences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a single dose study for the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is demonstr@@ able within 30 minutes after administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached in day 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dos@@ copic study , which was carried out as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , four subjects of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the application of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination possessed no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient called pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits at a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; March 2007 , and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to reli@@ eving allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance that can unfold its effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and drinking or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of a pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine which is contained in this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ sten@@ ic stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer which leads to a nar@@ rowing of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um ) , a closure of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases under the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations • nausea and head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of existing head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when applying in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately , if you should have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you forgot to take Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the intended time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you , or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heart disease , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , mou@@ th@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of blood , loss of blood sugar , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impaired vision , dry eyes , bleeding , stomach upset , bleeding , upset stomach , upset stomach , stomach upset , upset stomach , upset stomach , upset stomach , upset , anxiety , irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin rash are reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart disease , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , headache attacks , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ gr and 5 mg tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies of patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application of children is safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg ap@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom score ( symptom score ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the acceptance of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the symptoms decrease after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us across the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the previous disease progression and can be terminated after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in the framework of clinical trials involving the &apos; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n &apos; tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to an impairment of traffic or the ability to operate machinery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % of adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most commonly encountered side effects , which were reported more frequently than placebo , were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial involving 5@@ 78 patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which were treated with dis@@ car@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes both the hibition of release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 and IL @-@ 13 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ le as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion of the P sel@@ ec@@ tin to end@@ otheli@@ al cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple outlets in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chron@@ ically I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria was studied as a representative for further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be rec@@ tified more easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , this will lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria as@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ car@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and awareness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where the patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation , after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfasts ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color@@ less film ( includes lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hypo@@ cris@@ y , titanium dioxide , macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ ego@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ g@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are available which support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and experience higher compound load ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabol@@ ise , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , therefore patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose or in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the framework of clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not ampli@@ fied ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall frequency of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group , similar to the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose is 3 % more adverse effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were involved in anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple outlets in adults and young people , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied over 14 days a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was apparent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was determined compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not harmful to psych@@ om@@ otor functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced power impairment and an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adult and you@@ thful patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria as@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adult ; 16 % children ) than with chew@@ ing asi@@ ans ( 2 % adult ; 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study involving the sy@@ rup formation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that can be metabol@@ ised .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time period of about 120 hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation , after a daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 In various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III brown bottles with a child@@ proof polypropylene seal cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equipped with a rigid , transparent pol@@ yst@@ yr@@ ene measuring spoon , calibr@@ ates with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with an application spra@@ yer for preparations with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at once a day lay in the mouth to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophil@@ ism should be removed without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not established in the framework of clinical trials involving A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was tolerated well ; clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data were documented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple outlets in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied over 14 days a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily showed no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster has to be carefully opened and the dose of the hot tablets can be removed without damaging them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile provided for adult patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets as a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at to the neh@@ men@@ - formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant , in the course of a clinical trial involving multiple tin doses of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % ; children 3 % ) but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melt tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a 30 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurements of flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical trials for the enam@@ el tablet found that this formulation is an impro@@ b@@ able risk for local irritation in clinical application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which metabol@@ ise , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tos@@ e- intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ec@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this drug should not be taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall frequency of the side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group , similar to the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported that were reported more frequently than placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2.3 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study , at a dispos@@ able dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n &apos;s solution , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see under Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was determined compared to placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s or in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adult ; 16 % children ) than with chew@@ ing asi@@ ans ( 2 % adult ; 3 % children ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution contains the same concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it meets the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in various single dose studies AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company re@@ jects its application for approval of A@@ ha@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a special kind of vaccine , which is supposed to protect from a strain of influ@@ enza virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic spaw@@ ns when a new stem of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognizes the parts of the influ@@ enza virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies at a close contact with a flu virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , the membrane shell of the virus coinci@@ des with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a body alien ) , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the extent of the clinical data base for assessing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you require further information on the basis of the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific debate ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ a is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drugs the patient has previously taken , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus is addressed to the medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice a day , taken together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ a depends on body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in blood and keeps it at a low level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aids does not cure , but can delay the damage to the immune system and also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the drug A@@ gener@@ ase , which was d@@ osed with low dose , was compared to other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ meas@@ urable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) , or the viral load change after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies involving patients who had not previously taken a d@@ ase inhibit@@ or , more patients after 48 weeks had a viral load of less than 400 copies per ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ a reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who previously had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were very few of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase advanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for stronger tr@@ ash of the viral load after four weeks as with the patients who had continued their previous prototype inhibit@@ ors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of ag@@ it@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ a must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded just like as@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with other medicines against HIV , the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by a re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ it@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r were not proven in patients who had previously no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ a was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; given only limited information at the time of hom@@ olog@@ ation for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the transport of ag@@ it@@ ase throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from age of 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical boo@@ ster of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r should be carried out in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern , and the patient &apos;s pre@@ treatment ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as a solution to dispos@@ ing is 14 % lower than Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day , combined with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the added addition of p@@ inion ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 300 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous use should be performed with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines , which have a low therapeutic breadth and furthermore represent the sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
herbal preparations that contain St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , as@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal progression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the information of this product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are met@@ abo@@ lized by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 i@@ Mod@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the release of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of ammon@@ ia ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with ammon@@ ium , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under a age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an ex@@ a@@ zer@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the patients had other diseases , which were necessary for their therapy , associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ at@@ thro@@ cytes are present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can lead to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width as@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ym@@ atic 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with Low Therapeu@@ tic Wid@@ th A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly met@@ abo@@ lized by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening adverse events .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the attempt to balance the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the Am@@ bul@@ a@@ virus levels and if possible , check the viral load and add the St. John &apos;s wort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if c@@ love is given together with ammon@@ ium ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day that substanti@@ ate the effectiveness and safety of this treatment scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 52 % decreases if Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) is given in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and safety of this combination are not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , because of the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ one component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the proceeds of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , in combination with Am@@ bu@@ vi@@ ren@@ z ( 600 mg twice a day ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects of N@@ evi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that N@@ evi@@ c might sun@@ k the serum concentration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should these medicines be used at the same time , caution is advisable because Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution is required when these drugs are used , because thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ p u@@ tin resulted in an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ descent u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ descent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ gn@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ gn@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simultaneous use of 700 mg of f@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) compared to the value that was observed once a day without simultaneous use of f@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r once a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other drugs that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can possibly result in interactions with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions associated with these medicines , if used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da can not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it may lead to resor@@ ption disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous intake of a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cc@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels while administr@@ ating as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ise the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while using Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase can not be used together with oral mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while applying A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible rise in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 fa@@ che .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is currently given , such as the am@@ on@@ a@@ virus dosage , if Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with simultaneous delivery of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ bu@@ det@@ avi@@ r is transferred into breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a decreased increase of the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , came up early and rarely led to treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the side effects mentioned are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors have received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ a twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring ( grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients including a loss of body fat tissue with increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue ; hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( bull &apos;s ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients treated with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks only one case ( bull &apos;s disease ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study performed at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre@@ treated patients under Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skin rash was usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ cu@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules natural , with or without it@@ ching and disappeared spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with PI pre@@ treated patients who were treated 600 mg A@@ gener@@ a twice daily along with low @-@ dose spro@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( grade 3 and 4 ) which were observed in patients who were treated as@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the processing of viral gene and ga@@ g polym@@ ers , resulting in a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells .
the link between the activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with previously approved F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r refrac@@ tive treatment schemes , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , 700@@ mg of f@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r received twice a day in ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred by week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates were gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 detected patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors showed a resistance pattern similar to those in adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) to patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks with the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for f@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V or I@@ 5@@ 4@@ A / C / F / F / F / F / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / M / M / M / M / M / F / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M / M /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for estim@@ ating the activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain degree of cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ ly avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ances , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy not previously treated ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) and Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and tr@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
the proof of efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the PRO@@ 300@@ 17 study of a random@@ ised open study in which PI pre@@ treated ( 600 mg twice a day ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care SO@@ C ) were obtained .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase ; at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks with a non @-@ inferior threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the proof of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of which 152 were treated with PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ a solution was used twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no low dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell numbers of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered ( 600 mg twice a day ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on ammon@@ ium concentration 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of ammon@@ ium from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ bu@@ det@@ avi@@ r which is the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing interval depends on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss until C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with care if they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ bu@@ det@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is a 14 % less bio@@ availability solution than capsules ; therefore , as@@ gener@@ ase solution and as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not replac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these treatment schemes are leading to Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred with doses of 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily application of 1200 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeu@@ tical applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 showed high mortality , both in the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skeleton changes have been observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 If as@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the added addition of p@@ inion ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of ag@@ it@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice a day ) need to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simultaneous application should be performed with caution in patients with poor or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed for duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug addic@@ ts , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in plasma that were achieved in the combination of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) are administered twice a day in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended since the effectiveness and safety of this combination are not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors would lower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caution is required when these drugs are used , because thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ gn@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dose of ri@@ gn@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers like am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ p@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin ,
in a clinical study in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with simultaneous delivery of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ ti@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ manufacturing study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r in vitro to HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both on acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ant @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ oo@@ ster &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while absolute concentration remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredient during the dosing interval depends on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss until C@@ min , ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 should be administered with care if they are given at the same time using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be minimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals with doses of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas that were 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 times ( rat ) of the human exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the present exposure data on humans , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application there were little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen , nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at age of 4 showed high mortality , both in the control animals and the animals treated with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these results suggest that in young animals the metabolism channels are not yet fully developed , so that Am@@ bu@@ det@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children from age of 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ generative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were neither used with PI pre@@ treated patients nor with PI pre@@ treated patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as a solution to dispos@@ ing is 14 % lower than Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients should , once they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution to stop taking ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ a solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 2@@ 800 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additionally , as there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dose k@@ nights , this combination can be avoided in these patient populations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a dose adaptation for Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gener@@ a solution is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women and children under 4 years , with impaired liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive hem@@ ming of the metabolism of these drugs , and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 per transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed for duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ 49 related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ at@@ thro@@ cytes are present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r leading to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50@@ 8 % is increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r capsule ( 600 mg twice a day ) was administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simultaneous intake with as@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ ension , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . A@@ gener@@ a solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ bu@@ det@@ avi@@ r is transferred into breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ manufacturing study of pregnant rats , which was administered from the insertion into the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these events are not clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with previously approved F@@ os@@ am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r refrac@@ tive treatment schemes , the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the early departure of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which may affect the subsequent treatment adver@@ sely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered when optimizing therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 litres ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large c@@ ous@@ ins volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of ammon@@ ium from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cell aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skeleton changes have been observed that indicate a delayed development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - If you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may harm other people even if they have the same discomfort as you . − If any of the listed adverse effects you have significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply as@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of as@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor , and your treatment history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell your doctor if you suffer from any of the above conditions , or any of the above medications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ a capsules together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have read the use information to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before beginning treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likewise , there is no sufficient information to recommend the use of as@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance efficacy in children aged 4 to 12 or generally in patients under 50 kg of body weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rhe@@ a , disease feeling , vom@@ iting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - sometimes the rash can be serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can include fat loss of legs , arms and in the face , a fat gain in the abdom@@ en and other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat bas@@ kets in the neck ( &quot; stit@@ ches &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ co@@ l , macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ co@@ l 400 ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am @-@ potassium , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , sodium chlori@@ de , cit@@ ric acid , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate , puri@@ fied water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small cell carcin@@ omas it is possible to apply five times a week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants it is possible to apply five times weekly during one or two weeks of treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ ly applied to the affected areas of skin so that it leaves enough ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies to 9@@ 23 patients with ni@@ p@@ ples in the genital area each 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which the patients were treated twice a day or five times a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of treated patients a total healing rate of 66 % to 18 % in the placebo @-@ treated patients showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the placebo group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults , limiting the effectiveness and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leave Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine is long to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an interruption in the procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or when an infection is observed in the treatment area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , a different therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and place in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ ul@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was carried out , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a stri@@ ction leading to circumcision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation persi@@ sts and / or lead to temporary physical impairment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous antibiotics for the treatment of external in@@ clin@@ ations in the genital and peri@@ anal area , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited data indicate increased rate of genital war@@ ts in HIV positive patients , i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair attachment was not studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases generally during therapy or the reactions are back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made several days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after regeneration of the treated skin , the clinical result of the therapy can be evaluated approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ normal cell carcin@@ omas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , so the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower likel@@ ihood of response to i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ants on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area within the lip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very limited data on the application of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ical ker@@ ato@@ sis on anatom@@ ical positions outside the face , and scal@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions normally take in intensity in the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions had a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to immune stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although neither after one time nor after several topical application of quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation for application can be given during breast@@ feeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most commonly shared and possibly possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the location of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects reported by I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial , reported below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effect , were a response to the application site in these studies ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects , which were presented in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream , are listed below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this according to test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) and ex@@ ch@@ ori@@ ation / leaves ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this according to test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequently to severe vom@@ iting ( 31 % ) , serious ero@@ sions ( 19 % ) came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was detected with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ adver@@ tent unique or@@ ale recording of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clin@@ ically severe side effect , which appeared after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy in regard to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment is clearly superior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 60 % of the patients treated with I@@ mic@@ qu@@ im@@ od exhausted , they were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 % women who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % from 16@@ 1 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super @-@ modi@@ fiable bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of use in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or in the face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two @-@ year data from two combined observation studies indicate a recur@@ rence of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approved indications of external cow@@ war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ normal cell carcin@@ oma typically do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and have therefore not been studied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 ; placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these studies , the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application , during 16 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml ; on the scal@@ p ( 25@@ mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the estimated half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , which indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data for systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super @-@ defici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat @-@ rats doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG led to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects in the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week , did not indu@@ ce tumours on the application site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption out of the human skin and is not suspected , there is a risk for humans to look very low due to systemic exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tum@@ ors entered the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you do . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and the anus ( anus ) . this is a frequently encountered and slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it remains untreated , it can lead to changes , especially in the face - therefore , early detection and treatment is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their previous lives .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied in case of flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O If you have previously applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor if you have any problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and mu@@ zzle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if reactions occur in the treated area that cause you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . consult your doctor if they do not have a normal blood pattern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling of the skin or difficulty may be calculated with increased occurrence of skin irritation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should not use this medication for more than one treatment cycle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) perform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines , or if it is not a prescription drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not breast@@ feed your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , because it is not known whether i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine occurs in breast milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are var@@ ic@@ ose , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the war@@ ts and rub the cream cau@@ ti@@ ously on the skin until the cream is fully dra@@ ined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before applying the Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 6 weeks , apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream every 5 days a week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common side effects ( expecting more than 1 of 10 patients ) Frequ@@ ent side effects ( with less than 1 of 100 patients expected ) Very rare side effects ( with less than 1 of 10,000 patients expected ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you feel uncomfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reduced number of blood cells may make you more prone to infection ; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster , or cause fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patient ) or pain in the areas you applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually these are lighter skin reactions , which disappear within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application area ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , swe@@ ating , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the application area ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , ul@@ cer@@ ation , sensation or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , redness , facial swelling , sor@@ eness , sor@@ eness , or shi@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , bags ) are not broken down and thereby accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements difficult , decreased pulmon@@ ary volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or a clinic with re@@ covering equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to the administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided by the E@@ MEA is acknowledged How does Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was also measured ( by assessing its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me sank the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver at the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than one of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( reduced heart rate ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of the human α @-@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary ) .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dosage schedule can be recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ covering facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction need to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer break , the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions has to be carefully avoided after an interruption of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ gi@@ dium ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment should be induced by anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate when the reaction has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought down , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be weighed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , where the response has occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should not be used at the same time using Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , is recommended , while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is not too silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were predominantly treated as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) .
un@@ desirable drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing down@@ time and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children Un@@ wanted Drug Re@@ perc@@ ussions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with mainly severe de@@ formation and duration of treatment up to 12 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients , within 3 months after the beginning of treatment , a serum version of serum was found ( average after 26 days vs. 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or early retirement from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which did not affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the enzyme rate therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ate , and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzyme activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and recorded by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the FE@@ V expected to be expected , and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms every week ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) every week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of lung function and ability to be treated in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me group as indicated in the following table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period , and the absolute lung capacity increased further propor@@ tionally to the size of growing children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ ati@@ al prior to treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ mirror was detected in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing of 9 patients ( 20 % ) were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted to investigate the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with severe de@@ bu@@ gging form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four patients , dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in Week 22 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) showed a normal mental development speed according to the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the average follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed while the older patients with severe de@@ formation were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ous effects of various Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , but it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly , less severely affected patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines unless specified with the under 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the given time , the propriet@@ or has the following program to complete the following study programme , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , this register will provide safety and efficacy information to patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α @-@ L @-@ i@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount , or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me , or if you have performed a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me with other medicines , tell your doctor if you use drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructions for handling , di@@ lution and application The concentrate for making an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application ( see information for physicians and medical specialists ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing down@@ times and facial oils occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very common ( occurrence in more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in poor and legs • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion position &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package template will be updated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided the di@@ lution was performed under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer who does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce side effects , the patients should receive cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic medicine &quot; should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose blood @-@ image changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , cancelled or decreased the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells to divide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes much easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term of activity in cancer cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural otheli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a trial of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months compared to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival compared to the comparison treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to obtain permission for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved at 4.@@ 2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the required do@@ - sis volume is taken from the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC @-@ cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F for patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid can be given on the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid need to be taken and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of treatment as well as for further 21 days following the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third operation cycle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) and as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose checks must take place under the influence of the influence of the blood image of the blood or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding therapy cycles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC @-@ 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical studies did not reveal that in patients at age 65 , or in comparison to patients aged 65 , there is an increased side effect risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age , due to lack of adequate data for safety and effectiveness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials were not necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of ≥ 45 ml / min , which could exceed the dose adap@@ tations that were recommended for all patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data in patients with a cre@@ atine clearing of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with a liver function ent@@ ang@@ lement of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value and / or tran@@ vel@@ ine values of &gt; the 3.6 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( for the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) is not studied specifically in the studies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients need to be monitored with regard to bone market upp@@ ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a reduction in dose for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neutr@@ ality , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in level 3 / 4 of hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was supervised when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , all patients treated with mixed @-@ mixed patients need to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for reducing treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) need to avoid simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ sts ( &gt; 1.3 g. a day ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the ergometer is induced prior to the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 Sever@@ e cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated vital vacc@@ ines ( excluding yellow fever ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible expansion of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised in front of the treatment inn to get advice regarding the sperm count . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ IDs such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore caution is recommended if in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy should be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
as no data exists regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life like pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ opla@@ sty chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be used during pregnancy , except if absolutely required and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage of reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm conditioning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred into breast milk , and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following table shows the frequency and severity of un@@ desirable effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed patients as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ otheli@@ oma were random@@ ised as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity that were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed were comprised of su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity degree 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 mixed @-@ mixed mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 compared with Neut@@ ro@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ x@@ se 2 studies are included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in hospitals in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials reported occasionally cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in mixed mon@@ otherapy , or in combination with other chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients treated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ opla@@ sty anti@@ fung@@ al which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes required for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti@@ hyper@@ fol@@ ate with several attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ mus syn@@ th@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS - a multi@@ center random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ otheli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful benefit compared to those who were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients receiving the treatment arm ( random@@ ised , treated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural cancer was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted in an improvement of lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a decline in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised and open phase III study involving doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed a medi@@ an survival period of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( int@@ ents to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the impact of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on the overall survival occurred in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( n = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 ; p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with IT@@ T population analyses and support non @-@ sub@@ li@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin Com@@ bin@@ ation compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
middle P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25@@ ,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CI = Contin@@ ous interval ; IT@@ T = Contin@@ ent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ c showing for non @-@ sub@@ lim@@ ity ; with a total contrast interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ inferior frequency limit of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % versus 27.@@ 3 % versus 27.@@ 3 % versus 27.@@ 3 % versus 27.@@ 3 % versus 4.5 % versus 4.5 % versus p = 0.@@ 00@@ 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients also needed sel@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( p = 0.@@ 00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed as a mon@@ otherap@@ eutical were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine , and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in urine within 24 hours of application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total frequency of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study involving Be@@ ag@@ le dogs who had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us injec@@ tions for 9 months ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ eric epitheli@@ um ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unless otherwise applied , storage periods and conditions after preparation are carried out in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 @-@ 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dissolve the content of the 100 mg vial washing bottles with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preservatives . this results in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without imp@@ acting the quality of the product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 20 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the production of a concentr@@ ates for the production of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500@@ mg powder for the production of a concentr@@ ates to produce an in@@ fusion solution
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received previous chemotherapy in the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ural cancer in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and another medicine for cancer treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have kidney disease or earlier , please discuss this with your doctor or hospital pharmacy as you may not receive A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will be carried out before any in@@ fusion of blood tests ; it is checked whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and whether you have sufficient blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor may change the dose or stop treatment unless your general condition requires , and if your blood values are too low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you also receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you will receive the necessary medicines to prevent vom@@ iting before and after the plat@@ inum gift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a fluid accumulation is present around the lungs , your doctor may decide to eliminate this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you would like to receive a child during the treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interactions with other medicines Please tell your doctor if you are using medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) such as drugs called non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ gi@@ cs ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) including drugs which are not prescription ( such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your a@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your kidney function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can take , and when . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hospital pharmacy , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with ster@@ ility 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ ti@@ son tablets ( according to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a twice daily ) , which you must take on the day before , during day and day after using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be you fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) for taking or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins containing fo@@ lic acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) and prescri@@ be them once a day while using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and approximately every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) , you will also receive an injection of Vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this utility information , a side effect is described as &quot; very common &quot; means that it was reported by at least 1 out of 10 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is described as &quot; common &quot; , this means that it was reported by at least one of 100 patients , but less than 1 of 10 patients were reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a side effect is reported as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this implies that it has been reported by at least 1 of 1,000 but less than 1 of 1,000 patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fever or infection ( often ) : if you have a body temperature of 38 ° C or above , swe@@ ating or other signs of infection ( because you may have less white blood cells than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you feel tired or weak , get quickly in short@@ ness or look pale ( because you may have less hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a bleeding of gum , nose or mouth or other bleeding that does not come to a halt , or have a red@@ dish or pink or unexpected bru@@ ising ( because you may have fewer blood plat@@ el@@ ets than normal , which is very common ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
occasionally ( occurs at least one of 1000 patients but less than 1 of 100 patients ) increased Pul@@ se rate Co@@ litis ( inflammation of the inner lining of the colon which can be associated with hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in the intest@@ ines and end@@ bow@@ el ) ede@@ ma ( discharge of water into the body tissue causing swelling ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rarely ( occurs in more than 1 of 10,000 patients , but less than 1 of 1,000 patients ) &quot; Radi@@ ation Rec@@ all &quot; ( a rash similar to a severe sun@@ burn ) , appearance on the skin exposed previously ( a few days to years ) of radi@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; occasionally , patients receiving A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA , usually in combination with other cancer cells , received a stroke or stroke with less damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are treated with radi@@ otherapy before , during or after their A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treatment , an inflammation caused by radiation may occur ( scar@@ ring of the lungs associated with radiation treatment ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter , combined with low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ based diets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks , should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats introduced by food to the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had 4@@ 60 mg income after one year reported an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg in the ing@@ es@@ tion of placebo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss was observed for patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , outlet of o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( f@@ ences ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in patients with tran@@ spl@@ ant patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , it may not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) , and should be used in conjunction with a mild hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is not enough data for efficacy and safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ized , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since weight reduction is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients who take bal@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist , whether the dosage of these medicines has to be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is recommended that additional fluctu@@ ating contrac@@ eption should be taken to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in the case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases involving or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it should be recommended to take supplements of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the gift of a single dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who at the same time received or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of known side effects , which were determined after the introduction of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; † It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety , with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi @-@ doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were given over a period of 15 days to normal and overweight subjects , without significant clinical findings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a quick rep@@ lication of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s lip@@ ase inhibit@@ ory properties can be assumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic lip@@ ums .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at was taken three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat is blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day combined with a hypo@@ critical , fat @-@ fra@@ grant diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary parameter which changes the body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of the participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although in both studies , weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average change in the total ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ess was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of L@@ DL cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( starting value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metabol@@ ised or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In general , met@@ abo@@ lized or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and can be detected without signs of accumulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving obes@@ e patients receiving a minimal systemic absor@@ b@@ ant dose , M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 ) could be identified , approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take medicine and if you take medicines for high blood pressure , because you may need to adjust the dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for further helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 , how to set your calorie and fat limits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave a meal or contain a meal no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal containing too much fat , risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get used to the new eating habits , start before the first capsule filling with a calorie and fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nutrition books are effective , since you can always understand what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Do not eat fat , to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related supplements ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before taking the capsules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y during intake , and after taking all@@ i physically active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Al@@ i should not be taken for more than 6 months . • If you can &apos;t find any reduction of your weight after 12 weeks of use , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • In the event of a successful weight loss , it is not about to change the diet and then return to old habits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If less than an hour has passed since last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since last meal , take no capsule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you , or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects are related to the mode of operation of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks after treatment commen@@ ced , as you might not have reduced the fat percentage in your diet consistently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods , and about the size of the portions that you normally eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly to daily meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial night@@ stand . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases , such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes &amp; Cardi@@ ovascular disorders • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose meals containing a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note the below tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by observing the recommended fat supply , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week , without fru@@ stration and disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat aims and to keep it to mind . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calorie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in combination with a program tailored to your type for weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi may be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application for patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there is not enough information regarding the effects in this age group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 out of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 24 hours after chemotherapy , 81 % of patients treated with op@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) versus 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 19@@ 1 patients ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alo@@ xi is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in severe em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting due to a cancer illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon massage , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored close mes@@ hed after injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ ag@@ onists , caution is recommended with simultaneous gift of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in which the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a further chemotherapy agent , Alo@@ xi should neither be used for prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of five monitored chem@@ otherapeu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ cine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( d@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , fluor@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , meth@@ eus , ran@@ iti@@ dine , ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clinical trials were the most frequent side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least associated with Alo@@ xi in relation to head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies of adverse events were seen as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy with an Alo@@ is over@@ dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies a total of 1.@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life 4 hours ) or 100 mg of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study 6@@ 67 patients receiving a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received the 32 mg on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the results of studies with moderate @-@ use chemotherapy , and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , are summari@@ zed in the following tables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ut@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study was aimed at evaluating the EC@@ G effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absorption After IV administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ life time of approximately 40 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
after IV administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations , the total tex@@ position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 75 mg was comparable to the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in vitro studies for metabolism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser degree , the iso@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a single intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , termin@@ ale elimination of eli@@ oration and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient over maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only be blocked in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are implic@@ ated in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and increase the duration of the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in approximately the 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily for over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ m ( thy@@ roid gland , p@@ ank@@ re@@ as , pancre@@ as , pancre@@ as , pancre@@ as , mice ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is intended for a unique application , the relevance of these results is low compared to humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner of this permit for placing an agreement must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved in the context of this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the distribution of the authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue shows damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is produced by a yeast produced by a gene ( DNA ) , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that prove the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the effectiveness of the reference drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the study , we measured how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was adjusted to the medicine ( i.e. no indication of the virus in the blood ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon cured the disease in more patients than with the reference drug , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , the test used in the study was to investigate the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not adequately validated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection ) and small infected cells ( cra@@ cking or cutting burns ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or possibly caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infection may not work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all five studies , the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients whose infection was after the end of the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of infected skin cells Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin @-@ dogs , approximately 90 % of patients in both groups spoke to the treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( frozen cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , is a irritation at the job site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the following superficial skin infections with regard to the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small charging stations , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the launch of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients with no improvement within two to three days should be investigated , and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of a raising or serious local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials in secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an alternative therapy should be considered , if no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied , and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that were achieved in humans after topical application on a poorly treated skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 After having oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x following topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on sl@@ ated skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low systemic exposure to patients , can adjustments are not deemed necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues or should be continued or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues / terminated , considering the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most frequently reported side effect was Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the meeting place that concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin and a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) .
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a particular binding site of the 50@@ S sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data suggests that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; binding to this binding site inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ S ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appears to be question@@ able at least some infections , a consultation with experts should be sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absorption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on scre@@ wed skin for up to 7 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , which received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication , and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic absorption in people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhi@@ bitions .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in vitro testing on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo study chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which resulted in a prolonged exposure to 5 times more exposed skin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats were determined at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) and development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controller of the authorization for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , as presented in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application ( version 6.@@ 2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed and used as long as the product is marketed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the propriet@@ or is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance activities in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance Plan , as described in the version 1 of Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with the CH@@ MP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Guid@@ eline on Risk Management Systems for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted at the same time with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if irritation or other signs and symptoms show in the treated area , you should quit the use of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not apply other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it should not be applied in the eyes , in the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment is based on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile band@@ age or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic stopper that contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminium bag containing 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is used within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection while imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan can be carried out from two doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a refres@@ her dose is requested against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach the immune system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components , as the vaccine approved since 1996 , and the vaccine that has been approved since 1997 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adult and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adult were also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main indicator for efficacy was the amount of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a protective anti @-@ antibody concentration one month after the last injection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month gap between the two injec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a six @-@ month interval between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness and irrit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix should not be applied to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals , a permit for the integration of Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for basic di@@ mming with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a discovery is requested for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibody levels observed after a pri@@ ming procedure are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ os@@ competent individuals who have addressed hepatitis A vacc@@ ination may need a retri@@ bution as protection as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 As for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation formula is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disturbances of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody @-@ value is achieved after the pri@@ ming procedure , so that in these cases the application of other vaccine doses may be required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal impact rate , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection , combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us , was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , val@@ eri@@ ence , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in the former thi@@ odi@@ al and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of ambition were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s compatibility was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and skill based on a calculation basis , but not based on a calculation basis for each person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pain was observed following the application of Ambi@@ rix in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after applying a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects administered by Ambi@@ rix were over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to high ( i.e. , throughout the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects that were given Ambi@@ rix in comparison to 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency of pronounced pain and pain was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered , using the 3 @-@ dos@@ ages vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to what was observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 6@@ - to 11 year @-@ olds , however , vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix was reported a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported through severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dos@@ ages vaccine with the combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines ranging from 1 to 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the serum rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to Ambi@@ rix in the month of 2 and 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study for 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine scheme with a combination vaccine with a combination of 360 @-@ ELISA units and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to those observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formed H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibodies can be compared to 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered at the same time using a combined ph@@ th@@ eri@@ de , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us , the immune response was sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar serum and serum rates similar to the earlier formulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vaccine is to be examined , both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing , to detect any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viruses containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as waters contaminated through wastewater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you / your child are infected prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix already with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus / is ( although you / your child may feel uncomfortable or feel ill / feeling ) a vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If your child already has an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an allergic reaction can manifest itself through it@@ chy skin rash or breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccine against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever / has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months , and before the scheduled administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of an ino@@ cul@@ ation with Ambi@@ rix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead he will recommend 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients for each vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccine against completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected into the skin and not inj@@ ected into the muscle . if you / your child is weak due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s self @-@ defense / or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ goes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strong the reaction is on vacc@@ ination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 21 Tell your doctor if you / your child are taking additional medicine , or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or is planned in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many limbs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women is not given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second ino@@ cul@@ ation , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the in@@ stit@@ uting or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache , loss of appetite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; • Frequ@@ encies ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( above 38 ° C ) • Where di@@ gest@@ ed , gastro@@ intestinal disorders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 displaced doses ) are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these include locally limited or extended sur@@ charges that can be it@@ ching or b@@ lower , swelling of the eyes and face , troubled breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flu @-@ like complaints , including shi@@ vers , muscle and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , ab@@ norm@@ alities such as ting@@ ling , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , strong head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of neck , interruption of normal brain functions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ ain@@ ting infections of some blood vessels mal@@ nutrition or feeling of illness , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , or stomach pain caused by liver function tests ( blue stain@@ s ) caused by the drop of blood plat@@ el@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
23 Do not inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects you / your child are considerably impaired or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les , and in packs of 50 without need@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the data known since the first approval of the inver@@ ters , the CH@@ MP has assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since Ambi@@ rix was only launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the limited patient exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with a complete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is - divided into several single doses of meals - swal@@ lowed , fed into the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach in the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tu@@ bing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a comparative study , as am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo ( i.e. without an active ingredient ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps may also cause loss of appetite , a abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , unpleasant body od@@ our or weight gain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , too high ammon@@ ia values effectively prevented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval there was limited information on this drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ ac form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication exists for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy occurs in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake required for growth and development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from a lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk of the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each tablet of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occur via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it became a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal growth and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve end@@ ings in the brain , and therefore a disability of brain growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS in 56 % of patients at least an un@@ desired event ( AE ) appeared and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate epitheli@@ al and severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old baby with an in@@ ad@@ missible single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an metabol@@ ically active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , therefore , is suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and clinical results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant and the disease itself led to death even in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga in the first year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post @-@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of the pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fol@@ ate form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) that were treated by hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet the survival rate was 98 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were measured after applying a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate to so@@ ber healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after individual sharing and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different doses , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) showed no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma in the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % , in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate did not have any en@@ cla@@ ve effects ( investigation 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( babies and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight of over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients who suffer from a lack of carb@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ in@@ tran@@ carb@@ am@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium each 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate according to the maximum daily dose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when rat fl@@ utes were subjected to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a probable toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate epitheli@@ al and severe hypo@@ cal@@ emia and peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with ure@@ a is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , therefore , is suitable as alternative carrier for elimination of excess fluids . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle it can be assumed that for each gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible for treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this procedure includes the small measuring spoon 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium poly@@ but@@ yl rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the fat @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have laboratory tests done , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during breast@@ feeding , you should not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in rare cases confusion , headache , taste problems , tracking of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you notice one of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency room of your hospital to initiate appropriate treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , weight gain and anom@@ al@@ ous laboratory values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you , or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this use information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the exp@@ ir@@ ation date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the use of the container and the container . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , the contents of the pack AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat can influence the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have been taken recently , even if it is non @-@ prescription pharmaceuticals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should dose AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or over a stomach fever ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose led through the nose into the stomach ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
31 • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ules . • St@@ range a straight edge such as a knife edge over the top of the knife to remove excess gran@@ ules . • Rem@@ ove the recommended number of spo@@ ons of gran@@ ulate from the container .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a higher dose , and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox during all@@ ot@@ ments or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the PCI , the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they also received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ din , other hi@@ res or any of the other ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in , during the treatment of AC@@ S and for a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) , an emergency intervention or an early intervention is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out in further succession , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours following clinical requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the procedure a pin @-@ release of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial IV in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the safety and efficacy of a single angi@@ ox @-@ administration has not been studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI interference is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second release of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be achieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before application and the stu@@ d@@ ded dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the ACT is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with severe kidney dysfunction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ c@@ din against AC@@ S or not ) , lower in@@ fusion rates of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ACT @-@ value lies under 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second stu@@ n dose should be checked again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
patients with medium @-@ severe kidney damage that were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) included the ACT @-@ value 5 minutes after the application of the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also with di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients , angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ alized He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredient or against hi@@ p@@ one • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • serious kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when they are administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din , most hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment is in principle bleeding everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients who are using war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after dis@@ continuation of the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ din is once again reached prior to the treatment existing level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting from the knowledge of the mode of action of anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ dations with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ din alone 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ alized He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din group as well as in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more than 65 years of un@@ desired adverse events compared to male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe bleeding was defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for severe bleeding such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent among bi@@ vali@@ dations than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in point area , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood pressure point , re@@ operation to trans@@ fusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ zations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; mis@@ cell@@ aneous &quot; points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial involving bi@@ vali@@ din , with 6000 patients undergoing a PCI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both in the Bi@@ vali@@ din group as well as in patients treated with he@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years were more likely to have adverse events than with male or younger patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent among bi@@ vali@@ dations than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice following comprehensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in table 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of an over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ c@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is close mes@@ hed in terms of signs of bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vine inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic centre and the ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in t@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din on th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in and hence its effect is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in on its part spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly and thus re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , bi@@ validated th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ose Syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) caused no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia reaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ d exhibits a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory action that is occupied by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a PCI is carried out following a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg can be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or on the PCI .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the AC@@ U@@ ITY study showed the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography in 72 hours , spread evenly across the 3 arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography in 72 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ pin and 1- year end@@ point for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for the patients receiving aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple end@@ points of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are presented in table 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ din , as a pe@@ p@@ tide , passes a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent recycling of amino acids in the body pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the primary met@@ abo@@ lit which results from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 @-@ binding of the N @-@ termin@@ ale sequence by th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in patients with normal kidney function , the elimination takes place after a first order process with a termin@@ ally half @-@ life time of 25 ± 12 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; toxic@@ ity in animals after repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 @-@ fa@@ des of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to over@@ shooting pharmac@@ ological effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adverse events as a result of a longer @-@ term physiological strain than reaction to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short @-@ term exposure , even with a much higher dosage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution 17 is not carried out under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single dose containers of type 1 glass to 10 ml , sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap of pressed aluminum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a pier@@ cing bottle of Angi@@ ox and easily swi@@ v@@ elled until everything has completely dissolved , and the solution is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
5 ml are taken out of the pier@@ cing bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glu@@ cos@@ al solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ din .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who need treatment with insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose ( sugar ) in the blood , or insulin does not work effectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin ul@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it has a quicker effect and shorter active time than a short @-@ acting human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a slow insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in type 2 diabetes , where insulin does not work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was found in a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ec@@ onds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ul@@ is@@ ine or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs , which can affect blood glucose level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH a permit for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the abdominal wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any change of the active ingredients , the brand ( manufacturer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc ret@@ arding etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can change the insulin demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 An insufficient dose or the termination of a treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin , should be performed under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active part of the insulin , and can therefore be changed when the treatment scheme is changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the substances that increase the blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting Enzy@@ m , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ vation , can be weakened or missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between intra@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin related to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether insulin ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not occur in breast milk , nor is it absorbed after oral application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commonly : ≥ 1 / 100 ; often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare ( frequency based on availability of available data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive freezing , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection range , may result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be supervised in a hospital to determine the cause of urine for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the active time is shorter than with a healthy normal insulin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin ul@@ is@@ ine showed a proportional reduction of glucose in the therapeu@@ tically relevant metering range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg or more with a proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double as rapid response as normal human insulin , and achieves the full glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier as a human insulin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the data it was evident that an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ fla@@ di@@ onal gly@@ cem@@ ic control is reached as with a human normal insulin which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ fla@@ di@@ onal control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when insulin is applied 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , like with human normal insulin , which is given 2 levels before meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at administration 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine at administration 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
