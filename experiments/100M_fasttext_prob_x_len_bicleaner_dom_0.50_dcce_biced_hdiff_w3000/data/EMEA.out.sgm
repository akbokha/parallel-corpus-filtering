<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules agent that promotes the fusion of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes the microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network that is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the context of in-vitro studies has been proven that the presence of albumin feeds the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
