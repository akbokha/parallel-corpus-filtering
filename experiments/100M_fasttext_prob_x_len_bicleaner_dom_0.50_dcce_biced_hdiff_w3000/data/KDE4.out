&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translate the module website in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , translate the menu under Extras Website . select the source and target language of the translation from the drop @-@ down list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated as the whole &amp; URL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
machine translation is only very ru@@ di@@ mentary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only web pages in the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself , where you can insert texts to translate them directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some extra functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the Hand@@ book to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings to set up extensions .... Open the card tools and select the modules you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a list of standard installation modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note , possibly more modules on your system if you have additional software installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the crash module , click on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras stor@@ ze . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crash@@ es if available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module An@@ gle Fil@@ ters ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the root node of the document , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a more view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to show ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree Maps allows the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of objects of an object smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder . this way , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily recognized even if they are far below the folder hierarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched to color mode , can either display depth for easy identification of the ne@@ sting depth or the representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether there is enough space to display or whether the area is to be used by limitations in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always maintained . frames are drawn to allow less space to be lost when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space los@@ s@@ by frames so that rect@@ angle that is as square as possible . the best methods of this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Vie@@ wing on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an underlying entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets , designed for the application of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can find the Picture Gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , with which you can specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the title of the page allows you to customize the picture gallery page , in a text box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Pictures per line has a slider and a field of rotation , to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , see whether the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed in the gallery under the thumbnail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box size of the image , see if the file size is displayed in the thumbnail in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the image size check box , see whether the size of the images is displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fol@@ der dialog , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the file selection Save in HTML file , enter where the HTML page is to be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box , copy original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the comment text box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the check box sel@@ ectable colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML , settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , Display menu under the navigation pane or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; browser identi@@ fier changes a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the standard browser identi@@ fier for the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Moz@@ illa / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML ; like G@@ eck@@ o ) .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject the access with browsers on the basis of Moz@@ illa . for example you need M@@ SI@@ E browser identi@@ fier to call up with &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pages , which do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the set browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the menu entry , you can set the scope of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . of course every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with basic image processing tools . you can use them to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing skills can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins ( manual ) modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management - workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; improved database with much more metadata , like &amp; eg ; about the camera or the lens that can be searched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of end users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can ask questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to learn news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best start to join &amp; edit ; to participate , registration is in the developer mailing list . instruction to log in in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start &amp; edit , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter the path name , or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data storage is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an aging library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list take no photos as symbols . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; edit your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My key@@ word@@ lists to manage your photos in the albums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to figure out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder Settings , and Ro@@ h @-@ workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and support your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ kam ; albums . of course every medium and every card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera will then be used as a disk drive . the connection can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 supports digital cameras that support an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transmission over the serial port this connection is now dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the Ex@@ if support is needed by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 you may not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation might be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most beautiful things to do , is how easy it is to expand its functionality by modules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to complete a function when writing a small module to complete a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make the window easier , you can either remove the page strips with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; removing and dropping images works everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , through the horizontal separation line or into another application window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : J@@ PEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . so , the fil@@ ter@@ file will only work if this is shown in the symbol view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view to your photo albums . all photos that were created by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features give you information about this collection . in order to access the album properties , you must right @-@ click on the album and select the album properties in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album collections : include a method to select your albums , so that you can select a collection from the tool@@ bar or select View Albums . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums , sorted by date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buttons are oldest , average , New Year : these are used to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this is meant to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; When album preview quot ; you can also drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an album can only be included in a collection , and collections cannot be ne@@ sted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the input of keyword for individual photos in the area My key@@ word@@ list left below in the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images are displayed in this album in the picture window . each picture is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open an album the first time , you need to wait a little while the preview images are generated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on each picture is shown below the corresponding preview . which information these are , you can change the settings page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview images have help windows that appear . the help displays the most important features , including all key elements of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such a help window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photos and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can view all the features associated with &amp; digi@@ kam . you can choose from viewing the images , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can open the image processing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 image editing ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button calling and editing . in the editing pane you will find a guide how to edit your photos and edit them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking on the right mouse button and the program from the File Type sub @-@ menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview to click and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click the thumbnail and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it is moved to the tr@@ ash bin of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 image Del@@ ete or Ent@@ f Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; organize your photos based on the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date , or if this is not available , the date of the last change of the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the date to show you only the photos of the selected days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this keyword or a search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos marked with this keyword will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags can be arranged in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby , you can easily organize your keywords . you can also collapse parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word@@ lists , so you can easily find the keywords that you are looking for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can add new keywords by clicking on the right mouse button , or clicking on an existing keyword and then select New Key@@ word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and place there . then , a menu gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking on the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , select the image with the right mouse button and select Add as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo onto the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have chosen the photos you have chosen with a keyword , you can also click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select a photo with any number of keywords . in this way , you can select one keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the place where it was made etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have a photo with keywords , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can remove a keyword in which you can open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; include all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , collections , collections , date stamps and in the future even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking here , the filtering is deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab on the left side bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . you can search this search here as a search criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select to edit a search , the search will appear with the search information entered in . if you select to edit advanced search , you will find more rules for search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . any option can be added with others through the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or minimum ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number using a special technique , the hair algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any image . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , it will open and you can drop it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sketch : free hand sketch : draw a fast sketch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the right pictures , too . also here a threshold value can be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button around a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this requires your images Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a Live Geo@@ folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add to the illuminated table and open its window . when you are back in &amp; digi@@ kam , you can quickly open the lighting table with L extras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a picture series . if you navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , the two first pictures will be automatically loaded to the left side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , normal sol@@ dering transactions work directly from the table , e.g. F@@ 4 File Edi@@ ting .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all image information from the main window of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the table . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in pan function that can be seen on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the image , you need to press them and press the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zoom functions as well as in other views . simply use the zoom regulator under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zoom out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - apart from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process followed after the image has been taken to the final output and the permanent storage . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your images . we focus on the process for digital phot@@ ograph@@ ers to use &amp; edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , seeks , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports content to a monetary or cultural value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is based on your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I dare to say if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have on your computer . if you do not even know how many photos you have , use it for very quick searches and a secure archiving you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you need to decide if you want to store any other access to your photos whether you want to save it to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . note that you will need to switch to a larger drive at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures can be organized quickly on your location . if you make enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folders as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work procedures , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also recommend that metadata save in &amp; digi@@ kam in the settings page . if you forget this , you can subsequently save metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album Settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? add them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value . this makes sense as you can focus on the best photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often refer to other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam a tree is not a problem and can easily be done by moving a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to see most of your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of associations . you may even hear the silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you are moving about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is fine when a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) . you can even set it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? good because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with speed of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can use with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word@@ play with copyright and describes the practice the copyright to remove , restrictions on distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam , should be stored as information : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name or the name of the person who has created the photo . if it is not requested the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; examples of this can be as : employee Phot@@ ographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , these organizations can be listed here . if the image is a bearing photo , here is the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution to this problem is digital water@@ mark . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric shocks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . this type of loss is the same as you can also pass on traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can use good disks and good recording devices . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we require for format@@ ting and control sum@@ ming . despite this massive protection they age by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the latest piece of hardware , or software that can read the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your manufacturers include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : disc@@ ord@@ ant study &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most frequent error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT notice the expected life time between 4 and 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage . on your computer these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause heavy damage , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards , and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common protection against sp@@ ik@@ es is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer you should be aware that even all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers place over@@ voltage cont@@ actors which also have a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a large number of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a over@@ voltage protection , your system is protected from minor fluctuations in the power lines . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . if you purchase a U@@ PS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be achieved by up to &amp; euro ; 40 . at the end you should always remember how well your computer is protected .
the Amazon web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
you are compared to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) and Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services provided on photos . the professional version is more available to you in the case of Flickr . you get unlimited storage that should be checked in reality first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the worst thing is that nobody tells you when a transfer error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with plate errors at a low level . it &apos;s open source with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ ypass fil@@ esystem , which is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms called Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss for not@@ ebooks and 46 % on the work@@ station systems . for not@@ ebooks , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is 50 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage , for example theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ RC and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 stops settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology continues to develop there is a natural barrier for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year by a data loss . save your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as the re@@ installation of your operating system or the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash will hit you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot . forget air tragedy : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually concern a whole room or the entire house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , disaster prevention always means not local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as already mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite securing panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup , and the last differential lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . created several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time at which one such backup has been made . this backup will result in a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only sam@@ pled and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts r@@ sync only dup@@ lic@@ ates the difference of files that have been really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save important pictures directly after you have stored them on your computer , on a DVD or other optical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; topics : metadata , stored IP@@ TC data , retained X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing , ... , use of the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus valuable images will survive the next 40 year that is about the time span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the future is unfor@@ es@@ eeable because of your nature you have to look at everything what is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately there is no other way to have a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards , which are supported by many applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; virtualization is available to everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it on and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer default . stay open standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional expression of the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually always means increasing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability and want the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and shift it to a new record : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software is available , you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TI@@ FF is widely used as image format . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possibly one of the reasons why to replace its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology in 2001 to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF ; it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .@@ x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many photographers prefer to archive your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archive it , as it can store the metadata separately from the image file and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organisation dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards and work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert raw files to D@@ NG , and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ kam , then you should add the metadata again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . simply export them in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the section Add a photos to an album you can add a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam , connect them to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn on . a further description can be found in the hand@@ book of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some cameras may take a while . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information on each entry . with the side bars features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry and its metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button download and then download the selection of all of them . this downloads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the selected selection from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and select Sel@@ ected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not been selected by &amp; digi@@ kam . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of the existing albums will be displayed in the section My Albums tab . then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have downloaded the pictures you want , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the delete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore pictures that you have deleted from the camera . so , you should carefully check whether the photos are successfully deleted from the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image has been taken into the file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC data section . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo@@ - % Y % H : % S in the editing field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the option Camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ kam ; for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically if you open the next time the camera window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the camera orientation to start shooting . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded into the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and when your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turning , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all pictures with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the page bar Met@@ a data , you can check which information your camera could have embedded into the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is normally turned off , and in this case &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the image selection is finished , you ask where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted by your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS using the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS and the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to carto@@ gra@@ pher the area by automatic recording of GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply document this aspect , it is easy to save the location data of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and map references . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by sending the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . you need to save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and the GPS . on the following page you can see the same under &amp; Linux ;
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ sted coordinates to be created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give as much control over its operations as possible . to access these settings , you need to select settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between this by clicking on the icons on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the relevant IP@@ TC data fields when downloading from the camera interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this field should be desig@@ nations like e.g. employed photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
publisher is a syn@@ onym for vendors : use this field to indicate the name of the photo . this must not be the author if he / she works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC Fel@@ der@@ s. this way the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without going lost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save image descriptions as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in J@@ PEG image : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse cur@@ sor is in the main window over a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; see each file in a &amp; digi@@ kam ; album folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default settings can be reset , by pressing the button Update to the right of each category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters of the &amp; quot ; s display can be set to the default values . however , each time you open the table , you can only use different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , you can get better viewing results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select the tool@@ bar if you use image processing in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in the image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , since P@@ NG is using a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the TI@@ FF file option , you can un@@ zip the de@@ fl@@ ate compression algorithm for TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm performs los@@ s@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal J@@ PEG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image processing was only an image viewer for photos . currently , it evol@@ ves very quickly to a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option records the image a bit soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this option is set , the white balance is used for the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance , which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights so the parts of your camera are burned in due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed lights . finally you can try some parts of the missing information from the top lights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the yet uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you will have the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should be individually adapted for each picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the raw data that many cameras have and which is available from the color filtered image sensor . this algorithm is also known as a CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color structure .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ous Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correc@@ tive values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction , as it is done during the raw conversion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions how to be returned . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information , how to translate colour information from one colour space to the other , are to make the colors as accurate as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behavior Ques@@ tions , when a picture opens in the image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders Fol@@ der the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are color administr@@ ated not the entire screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some such as Canon which do not contain any color t@@ onal mapping or g@@ amma correction . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate on how your image can be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print image as your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be done manually instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most cameras , it &apos;s pretty obvious what color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here &apos;s a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognise the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for neutral , P for neutral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing software . by providing this interface you can work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use and these will be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules , can be set to set short commands in the menu under Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob controls the time between transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the camera features on the left shows a list of all supported cameras . on the right hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage is supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . you have to specify the path to / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able on which you mount your camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use &amp; digi@@ kam your digital camera , you need to connect the camera to your computer to bring it to the display mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check out if &amp; edit ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the confirmation dialog option for moving &gt; Images in the M@@ ül@@ ten@@ mer , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; in del@@ eting a photo in one album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without any questions , otherwise you need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also display the display of the Welcome Screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; under circumstances , this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select Start From start to new photos , search &amp; edit the base folder after new or deleted albums / photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can select the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , see more in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to review and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by selecting the entry / Edit menu .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam . so you may not be part of your distribution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a menu bar at the top edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editing functions of the editing change your photos . none of the functions will change the original photo before you have used File Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should , therefore , make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done using Save As . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore or Rest@@ ore button Rest@@ ore in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost every action in the editing process can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one , by editing or re@@ covering editing by selecting re@@ producing from the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for the und@@ o and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ shrink @-@ Z to restore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; on the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the menu File . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter in the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the Per@@ sich@@ ts menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . if you do not want this , you can see this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the image in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sets . you only have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Menu Ex@@ ports Print Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window has a side bar on the right , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multiple clicking on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear , resp@@ . disappear into the edge again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IP@@ TC data will only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments will be trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are res@@ h@@ aped . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label panel in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have commented , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the application button , there is a button More . with this you can also read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . this is always done when you have selected a metadata adjustment that is always written in the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time select this and use the context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the valuation is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency , and the coding follows the scheme in the following table : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the keyword screen shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with previously applied keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image are stored in the keyword ( IP@@ TC ) keyword , keyword . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to have a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Filter section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page bar Key@@ word Filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar is used with their album - date , keyword and search . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also draw and disc@@ ard keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is selected on no keywords , and a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and there is a dialog to whether this keyword is to be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this search for changes takes place at every start of the program , and can also be turned on different settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , key word , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why were pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? free space is limited to 1 GB and you won &apos;t want to save the images in full resolution .
this tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I made it mainly to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why you use a color managed workflow is that the colors of your camera or sc@@ anners may have a predictable deviation from the actual or sc@@ anned colors . with a color managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your screen are the same and the colours that you print or publish in your digital dark@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meaning of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with lower information will enable you to make informed decisions so that you can obtain the desired result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB color space . ( see further information below )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your only other image expenses are by e @-@ mail or the web , where s@@ R@@ GB is the de facto standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another colour space and make thoughts about color management ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space and the tri@@ angular region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do I need to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ R@@ GB colour space or not you need to calculate your monitor as s@@ R@@ GB assumes that your ; on@@ itor closes on s@@ R@@ GB . you either need to use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard or use a suitable monitor profile or both .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functions norm@@ alize , balance , automatic comparison and contrast , extend from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ t Automatic correction attempt automatically to make your colors the best . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the density values over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magnet correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic comparison : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enhance contrast : this method enhances the contrast and brightness of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in between . this is only visible when the images are washed out and can be a good correction for bad photos .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam , is a semi @-@ automatic tool to complete the white balance of a photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are too far from the original image you can perform over@@ exposure . if you can perform the white balance in the blank mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . if you want to see the original white balance , click the sub@@ window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic changes will be changed once you change a parameter . with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or down the shadow details of your photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to play a stat with the above controls you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the color temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are automatically set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure indicator increases colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save as and Up@@ load buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set , you can save in a text file and load it later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences button sets all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photograph as your original . if you store them will change your original image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF , and D@@ NG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be applied by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instruction for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always needs the same correction and you will always need the same correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colored , darker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . the result was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect finely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation thereby making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameters Level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the brightness of the photos . you can also experiment with the different colour aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . you can use the button O@@ k and you will be used .
if you do a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the opposite problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ intensity / Con@@ tr@@ ast / G@@ amma , the tool is based on sound value correction for improvement of exposure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pane contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slider are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controls , and take care of how the image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamically updated based on the settings of the image . on the left , the following options are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column for images of a digital camera . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three controls : the top@@ most for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three colour pin@@ board can be used in previ@@ ew@@ ing the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for fully automatic alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators which can be used to modify the output values as background as in the input values . the compression of the output values can e.g. be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save as and store : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and later loaded . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below is an example of the alignment of input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , half of the original and the target screen are displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode creates a wide beam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you move a curve back to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and the corresponding pixels become darker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each turn you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels in order to show over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam channel mixer , image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour shad@@ ings of the photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer , image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison with your own rider .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram shows you the corresponding color value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the general brightness as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of color leads to a visible noise that does not appear on the same spot in the color channel and whose noise patterns are different in each channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as and store buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Over@@ exposure Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been adjusted . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) , and the illustrated image below ( 2 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction ability . with the development of digital photography black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film strip with a green l@@ enti@@ ls filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits especially well to the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; orange filters : simulate a black / white film strip with orange l@@ enti@@ ls . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film strip with a red l@@ enti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic light effects and can simulate the lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film strip with a yellow l@@ enti@@ l filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading leaves . this is very similar to the process of getting a pressure and developing in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ ph@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth , or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a paper tex@@ tured effect was applied on the photo below . the original image has been ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; digi@@ kam , tool frame can be added a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
holding the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . it is bor@@ dered with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) . it is surrounded by a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a but@@ ton@@ ing effect and decorative trim adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the width of the frame is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the target pattern decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this convenient tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . the larger the image , the larger the character set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you click the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template , you can put a template over an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the menu image Tem@@ plate apply in image processing can be used to create templates via a picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to work with maximum comp@@ ressing ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button Basic folder in dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the root folder has been placed for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . selecting a folder will automatically update the template of the template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse , check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smaller : this button reduces the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move : use this button to move the image below . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use OK when you want to apply the template to your image , and the image will automatically adjust the preview size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to let a picture look shar@@ per . actually it doesn &apos;t work a bit . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that blur@@ red edges should be combined with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more sharp@@ ness than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . however , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sc@@ anners are using a sharp@@ ness filter during reading the image . if you disable this , you get control of your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus . you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ter soft draw and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove sli@@ me from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original image and the preview help to edit the image . in addition , the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values produce good results and should first be tested . an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , images should be best shar@@ per in their final resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ping image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid plastic fla@@ ws in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was used with Radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.@@ 0 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focus usually results in better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice the circular F@@ itting works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ itting has a very long tail . the F@@ IR Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ itting is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in good results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correlation : a correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filter can accept values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is most often caused by a non @-@ shar@@ per filter . if you use a value non@@ zero , you may need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . however , an increase in matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circle edge or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saving as and loading buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections in the picture before using the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that a lot of operations that are not visible immediately , but later leave unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as J@@ PEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , blur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood than sharpen@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even under optimal conditions , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna filter is always at least as good as the blur@@ red mask . the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this image has been made with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information about the field correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulator smooth@@ s the sharp@@ ness of the area that has been dark@@ ened , in order to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; color tin@@ ting allows for a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image error correction tool is one of the most recently developed tools to remove un@@ desired arti@@ facts , with unprecedented speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tool includes various pres@@ ets as starting points , to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use tabs smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detailed description p &#91; 0 &#91; 0 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smooth@@ ing over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly into all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . J@@ PEG arti@@ facts are best removed with a value near 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above s.@@ p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is gone . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle @-@ width &#91; 5 : 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small it should also be small . make sure small angles create a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by selecting this option is minimal . however , it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let it out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save as and Up@@ load buttons do exactly this . correct any setting of picture errors can be saved into a text file , and re@@ charged later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can last very long and take a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can see how picture errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . as you can see there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act done in the foreground that caused by bad film storage during the trip . the original image is under ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts such as dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can stay with default settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur@@ red the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors are adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . if the value is too high , you may need to adjust the edge filter if the value is too high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
edges : control the edge accuracy of the filter . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong you can not remove all noise or noise peaks . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or J@@ PEG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend either color or lumin@@ ance to change to a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
d@@ amping : controls the adjusting of the phase of the phase . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius will react on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is too high a noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear at the edges . it can remove noise peaks and is the recommended method for this .
store below and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ter soft draw and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scratches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
J@@ PEG compression arti@@ facts reduce : compression from J@@ PEG is not perfect in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm he creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed picture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file , and later loaded again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below you can reduce how a photo with uniform noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures are reduced to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . the original image can be seen under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows the Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight have to be removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw material photos because many cameras with J@@ PEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; at present there is no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the button dark@@ screen . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly following CCD defects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . note that the Wiz@@ ard will notice the last dark image and will automatically load it back in the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the picture . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all thumb@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an area to view the defective pixels on preview and the results of the filter . afterwards , select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
section : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all the defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance from 1 pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been magni@@ fied to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wide angle lenses , particularly those in the middle and large photo format , can often illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by using the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many center filters require a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the large exposure areas of today &apos;s Fil@@ men@@ and Color and Film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying an equivalent C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and three further imaging of the target image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density filter . the default density is 2.@@ 0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or randomly to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , since you only need to increase the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want a fin@@ er re @-@ adjustment of exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ dation menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a Leu@@ ch@@ amp and contrast correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions cannot be corrected using this tool .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the second graph deals with the general geometric distortion of the lens , and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar conc@@ entri@@ c effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion of the fourth degree . this value is stronger than in the middle of the picture . for most l@@ enti@@ ls the &apos; corners &apos; parameter has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value re@@ counts the image size and thus leads to a correction of the first count . negative values decrease while positive the image decreases .
ligh@@ ten : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog editor illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as all first by . in case you need to cut a picture and then perform a tone @-@ shaped correction the effect would be evi@@ dently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to an important place such as the edge of the sea or a building wall in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them from the image processing or the Zoom slider on this dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next logical step for some motifs , such as images from the front , frame and paintings , is to correct the angle in the picture 90 degrees . keep in mind that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the tone @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ anz@@ o.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra @-@ film . see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to rotate film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO knob changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows become white like snow !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter set applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter film grain is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of films the manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photographic emul@@ sion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter several times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil paintings create the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil paintings give your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for larger images . smooth@@ en the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the sharp@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixels wide picture is 1 and smooth@@ s 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sketch . the lines whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two controls with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect , the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ s ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digi@@ code ; filter engraved your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ och@@ ial landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the depth allows you to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art with distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wave blocks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and lets it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wave blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 , the picture here is distorted by a different version of glass blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur@@ red effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
zoom blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a central point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ red : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of an un@@ focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
blur@@ red movement : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving star : B : taking pictures from a car or train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos , or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image by randomly shift the pixels , thereby simul@@ ating the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligent blur@@ red : finds the ink tank in the picture , and bl@@ urs it without changing the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then create it , by filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel this calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your image . this gives it natural your images a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drops on the image .
you can use the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing a area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can mirror it by mirr@@ oring or rotating in the right direction . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ forming Tools menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo , with minimal loss of image quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate an image and keep the details sharp ? how can you recover or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select Change size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool for sizing uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approach pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New dimensions , and are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preserve aspect ratio : when this setting is checked , the new size will retain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Save as and Lo@@ ads are used exactly for this purpose . enlarge Every single st@@ amping for photo , can be saved as text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and take a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo you need to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drawing the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you release the mouse button , the area of the photos is cut off . this allows you to change the size of the area to be cut by clicking on the corners of the rect@@ angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the editing button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tri@@ mmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners to the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below in the dialog , you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sett@@ ling aid settings allow you to hide help , so that you can better put your pictures together . these help are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
harmonic triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide the rect@@ angle into a similar harmonic triangle on the diag@@ on@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; golden center : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the golden division is the irr@@ ational figure of 1.@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who built their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects used the golden partition in all times when you assembled your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the golden centre provides more liquid auxiliary lines , when you place an image . these aids are listed below : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in comparison to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden square rec@@ tan@@ gles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden square . note that unlike harmonic tri@@ angles and golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can be arranged a static object more dynamic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Options horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture at any angle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you make a photo , it is easy to keep the camera exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are stated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the right top .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for your help , the module Free Rotation provides horizontal and vertical lines . move the poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the rotation , but keep in mind the above warning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are carried out around a fixed point of the reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture , and is represented by a red circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new width : indicates the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new heights : indicates the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed region .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image will be slightly blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the image with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sc@@ aling tool is used to move a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . this is no rotation , the image is distorted to a parall@@ el@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sciss@@ ors your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ et , the angles are set to zero . a preview of the effect will show you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the preview pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point like the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single shot this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ti@@ dings produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove them is to cut the image with transform@@ ers cutting from the image processing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , compiled by the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find J@@ PEG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list you can edit this list of file extensions . see the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital images . thereby , redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ PEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than J@@ PEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to learn more about the picture format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can download raw format images in J@@ PEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the d@@ cra@@ w program which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam .
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often generated in avi@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and is not equipped with any built @-@ in possibilities movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playback of movies use to start playing the program .

K@@ IP@@ I module which exports a number of images into a K@@ ML structure . K@@ ML files can be opened and displayed using Google Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , you can do the first four alignment with the module white balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many tools you need to edit the photo editing are contained in &amp; digi@@ kam , included . your description will follow here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use a uniform slide type , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current picture . below , you can see &amp; quot ; texture app@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current picture . on the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area to the right of the selected preview section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper section shows the original , and the lower part shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left section shows the original , and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the upper section shows the original , and the lower part shows the effect of the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page bar features the essential information about the selected image , and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo features : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from EX@@ IF data , if they are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . press C@@ tr@@ l ; press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button around a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course this requires your images Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes , for selecting and nam@@ ing colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ allet files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Di@@ alogue palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders to files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor is displayed in the pallet view as line . it can be moved , by clicking on the area next to a color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color is described in the palette view . here , too , the color name can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used to select such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor over . then move the mouse while pressed left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is selected under the button Color , the color will be inserted from the color chart on the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ write another ; depending on whether the over@@ writing mode is selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions Cop@@ y , Cut and paste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end marker , if there are three numerical values in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colors in the palette , and the color selection can be moved with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then find them in the color selection on the left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; s &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are used in science - especially in computer science . the programs that include &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are in the opinion of the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical user interface , with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; shows Gra@@ phs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; GUI ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; Po@@ or ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; makes ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and is represented in &amp; graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Po@@ unds ; to open or the graph in &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; opening in a &amp; bil@@ ingual ; component
loading large graph@@ ene ( currently there are problems from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to present more than these k@@ not )
other required software : &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of the graph . requires in detail :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graphs viewer , the main window is empty like in the bottom screen shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the bottom screen shot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and low without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both directions , the zo@@ oming is limited by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file has just been modified to be changed from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to change the change . if you want to change your decision later you can change the settings k@@ graphs viewer ; set up ... see also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can open an instance ; in the file browser or on the command line , you will have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it using the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages , and the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use several pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages , without header and with a different font &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page Renew@@ able Lo@@ ad gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can select a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or ask the program every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a window of the already running session ) or specify that every time it is requested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the page seating administration provides the ability to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphs viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) , or define the default behavior at any start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can choose among various &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom , or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; N@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ compressed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada ca@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spr@@ int model layout for ung@@ eri@@ zed graphs , and contains a multi @-@ grid @-@ trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm classi@@ fies the node in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for specific diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command should specify the graph file as parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ o@@ dot format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determines the type of graph ( straigh@@ tened or ung@@ rounded ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed and ne@@ ato ; for un@@ eri@@ zed graph ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is checked , the overview is displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read the K@@ IP@@ I module images , tools are available to read new pictures and save them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scan pictures : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the San@@ e project or another source , like video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you open up the menu entry , a dialog appears which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by choosing the default values duc@@ ts own to select your image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure the window is displayed completely , since some settings may not be displayed otherwise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you have pressed the button scan you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to fix the options of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have selected a screen shot in the Im@@ por@@ tier &gt; Display menu , you can create a window in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the complete desktop , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will only read the window under the mouse after a short delay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay determines how long the screen shot will be waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other areas of work , you should choose this delay high enough to have time to navigate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the screen@@ shot is made , the Di@@ alogue options dialog with the options described above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet . Flickr is able to send photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world and show photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos to your friends and family all over the world .
the Ex@@ ports module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is basically your reference to Flickr . a browser is started so you can register with Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Flickr website and will be presented to you after a successful registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will see the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Flickr . this will be shown in the next section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module ex@@ porting to Flickr is launched two times , you will be greeted with the following dialog that displays the current access rights that the module displays . you will be asked if you want to continue using these per@@ missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press on the O@@ k button the up@@ loading of the photos to Flickr server starts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a , which are added to the image as keywords during upload . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lies , you can set the per@@ missions on your images . by default , the photos are classified as Priv@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value registered with Maximum size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images , the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your collection of images to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF keyword of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude are used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can result in a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the images that you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation exec@@ utes the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . put your camera time zone here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maximum time difference is the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera speed . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you do not have track data from one location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog will notice the coordinates of a call to the next , just use the OK button to put the data in the current photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the region and increase it again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and set the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab allows you to select all the albums that are exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right side will allow you to quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option For each image will create a page where the image is displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all of your images . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the J@@ PEG file format , EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thumbnail images allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnail images , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a progress window indicates the user , how far the action is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore start the program messages to see if errors have occurred while generating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or slide . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start , a picture is shown in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I J@@ PEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool to change images without affecting your quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module allows for the actions below to save images in J@@ PEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size rises , since there is no compression of the color information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the metadata module import function , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image you want to copy to the main program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . J@@ PEG is supported when writing . please refer to ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG coefficient module is a tool to convert a number of images to an MPEG video , in the form of a slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the module MPEG coding can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Sli@@ deshow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can create a background color for the Sli@@ deshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you first need to pick the images that are packed into the MPEG dial . afterwards , you can start creating the module via extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images you select will then be listed under image files in the Portfolio . there , you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , however , very smooth image changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and path of the created file can be set using the name of the MPEG output file . keep the .@@ mp@@ g as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , you can start coding the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a suggestion appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages on the button Settings right below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . this is , for example , useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your ima@@ gery stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats J@@ PEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from it is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first option determines whether the camera settings are to be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . J@@ PEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you are planning to edit your images frequently or otherwise use J@@ PEG format later you should not use the J@@ PEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose J@@ PEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the J@@ PEG file in the ex@@ if information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion using the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use ab@@ ort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images to one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the possibility to automatically over@@ write existing file . however , this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all the images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the number and the time stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can resi@@ ze or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to customize your image to the screen format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not proportional , proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; print preparation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can set the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the pictures to be sent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have started the module , the images will be displayed with the images you selected . you can add more images via the button Add images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also drag images to the list of images , and drop them down to add the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the button Clear , remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
once you have selected all the pictures you can open the New message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the pictures you select will be attached as an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails , if you want to send many pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration will be saved , and used every time until you change it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images will be merged into a text file and attached to the email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . otherwise we recommend the J@@ PEG format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select J@@ PEG under image file format and the original files in J@@ PEG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the process is done , the window will not automatically close , so you can see the status messages on the search for errors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au module , a window with questions like you would like to show your slides will appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will activate very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to own a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option file name will display the file name of the images in the lower left corner , while the presentation will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop , so you can cancel it manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order , so it is not used the order of the images in the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delay between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds are equivalent to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . randomly , at each transition between the images a different effect sel@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I teams under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : the participants of this list speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with comments , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , you are now present in each group , in people , places and in group keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current preview images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the browser view changes . see picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images , to a few images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can store your own preview picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu , you can select which view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , you must select the image for each individual person . in the context menu , you can select the image for the respective person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you visit the search in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the image properties dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images according to certain names as you can see in the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go to the &amp; k@@ photo@@ album homepage ; and watch the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; go to the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document for downloading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar is shown here : . as the name says it shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can edit the displayed entries preview from the database ( if you select a date , the tim@@ eline will always show the current date of the currently displayed images if you navigate in preview view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select a range of time bar by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the tim@@ eline . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas of content , layout and destination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ example pages see an example of these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ stly , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed by a party . for example , all images are exported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . by doing so , those who support your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 should have no more pictures , for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewers of your site may change the resolution at any time you set . it can therefore scan your images with a low resolution , which results in less transmission time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and will be automatically selected for all future images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have created your images , you can check if you have created a URL for the base folder . if you select a URL for the base folder a web browser will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that the HTML files you created are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . this is not the sub@@ folder of the actual files , but the base folder where all sub@@ folders are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings you just described have related all three to basic folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you may want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import them to your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external files . the advantage is that you can save all images in the file . the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the images are not found in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file , the images of the URL you have given when creating the HTML files are searched . this is , of course , only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described which you can call through the Export menu ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files , and the following three options are available : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Manu@@ ell option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , you must copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; copy &amp; photo@@ album to the Automati@@ cally in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , the images automatically for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed with J@@ PEG and the XML file itself is very small , please choose the Export file option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might want to limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu Import ... select , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you must select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the imported file ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called to persons . therefore , in the third dialog box you will be asked what categories of file to be imported , and what categories they correspond to in your database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth step , you can balance the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this manual , you will receive the various steps from ( 1 ) Deter@@ mining the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the browsing and viewing , to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file in the top folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are saved and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml .
over the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings will be explained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , which allow you to view settings and options for the viewer . for each setting you can call the F1 key and click on the option you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also define your own groups like objects , animals or albums for each picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of one member as explained in this section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the list below , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window of the window is a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphics applications such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the modules are used by several applications together it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you should always test new modules with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me I would not have warned you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are just a folder . even though &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support the order for albums so you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the modules also have to hand over a list of albums . here , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it will use the category you have set in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category People , you will have &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so if you have selected people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the picture , you can see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with comments . this includes information about the persons depicted on the image . for example you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can see in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , because you will always use it again whenever you enter information about your pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be moved , so that the names used can be moved up and assign persons more quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorted by date on the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected remarks for each image individually , you may want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at one time with a note . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the picture , you can see a browser window displaying the USA as a over@@ board . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context menu of the comment dialog , you can add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . note , this requires you to sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar , which form the top edge of the frame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have adjusted the window look to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... to save you the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you would like to view this window later , use the Options ... and click here to hide the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you select the pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumbnail images of the currently selected images , or all images if you do not set filters . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply drag the mouse using the middle mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as background image for your desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also delete pictures in the preview . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete , or select either the Del@@ ete key or select from the Edit menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images anywhere so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . for the images 5 @-@ 9 , however , the preview images are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can not view these images with the image viewer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , you need to copy files from folders and copy them again . so , if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid mixing your images , please purchase a larger disk to save all images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pictures menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images that you may want to see for others and click on the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have fixed which images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you want to lock your laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . in order to set up this password , simply select password in the Privacy menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for one , all images on the hard disk and on the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; administr@@ ate and spend hours over hours so you want to describe it is natural that you will want to look at them sometime . for this reason you can start looking at a picture _ and video viewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the viewer can see you in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have to enter via the image , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the information box appears on the top of the picture you want to see , you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have loads of pictures in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when multiple images are loaded in the viewer you can run them as slides . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or Min@@ us .
a very useful feature of the viewer &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album viewer ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you use the viewer , you can move in and zoom into the image . zoom @-@ key zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the key button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the only zoom operations that work with videos , that are in and out zoom with the plus and negative key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the turning functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at images it can happen that you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment , you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to select this name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to view the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the images and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature in which the characters A , B and C are set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the preview window . if you are viewing categories in dre preview , you can add features to the feature after selecting the character after the image has been selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will be allowed &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mixture is not stored in the image , but in the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to complete the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed to enable you to select the correct position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Del@@ ete , either from the menu bar to edit or from the right mouse button menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have altered attributes , click App@@ ly to adopt these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object with help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user &apos;s documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
press preview in the properties view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . if you just want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) tick locally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen shot shows the camera &apos;s control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to that of the scene selected in the tool@@ bar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left , and the four graphical views on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different layout , you can set it as you like . you can also store several window arrangements and simply switch between different arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to anchor a window or under a view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle will show the new position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to arrange several views over one another , drag the starter right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the left pointing arrow in the touch strip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the touch strip . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current window view can be saved with view window order ... save . it displays a dialog , where you can store the window arrangement under an existing or new name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you created a scene you can render them render . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering ; this program has to be installed properly . this version is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ren@@ ame the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the view scene ren@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a render mode is similar to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels you can insert any number of render modes from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender modes , the following dialog is opened : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to make sense to recognize the properties of the mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the framed picture . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not indicated when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is ali@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing , to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the standard is adaptive and non @-@ recur@@ sive ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is always further frag@@ mented and adaptive because the recur@@ sive depth depends on the calculated color values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a ray per pixel . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be comp@@ uted , with a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abs are abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixels are split into 4 sub @-@ pixels which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another possibility to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the beams add a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
diff@@ use reflection is the last adjustment for rendering quality . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays don &apos;t have hit the object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; unexpectedly terminated , you can find the reason for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; import the scene , select File import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you want to import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , and in your editor you can also paste source for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; ren@@ ders a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on Help in the Property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation of the displayed object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example altitude data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder , you must also use the path to these files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color for the wire models , the second color is used for displaying selected objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the color of the rect@@ angle for the visual field in the camera view , and in the window @-@ type registration plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the object by@@ catch of points to the grid in the contex@@ tual menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; larger values result in a more accurate wi@@ re@@ frame and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to the perspective and vertical projections . this property results in a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when displaying a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you tick the bottom , a bottom is rendered under the objects . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold values in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mod@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in the window arrangements section , you will see how to create and store window arrangements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination field standard window arrangement : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , uses the chosen window order at the start of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of existing window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement , you can create using the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the button Clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique , and must not be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be added to the button Add and delete selected views with the button Clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new window displays a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ ten anchored the window under the existing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene among beginners : a sphere on a level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you should carefully consider the following warnings , before you complain that you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not set a camera , you cannot apply rules for rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not include light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing tool@@ bar symbols . please read the documentation to get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera , showing you the result of the scene rendering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view that you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you push the user or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plain as ground : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the application or the input button . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wire model view now also shows the level , if at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane stretches to the horizon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the item on the item + before the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first select the bottom to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in both cases a dialog opens in which you can choose how the object should be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can see the name in the properties view ( Name = bottom pigment ) . you can see the name in the properties view like the pigment now looks like .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the pig@@ ments preview only shows a matt black material , because you can still view the pig@@ mentation settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on a fa@@ der and bul@@ let in the preview , just click on the App@@ ly button and then start the preview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image by clicking on the icon now , you should get the following result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the color list you have to type two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the object tree , select and change colors in the object properties view : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step should be easy to execute , since you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : 1 ( Don &apos;t forget to push the input button or button ) , otherwise the ball would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground down one unit down@@ wards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , rendering is a strange result : as already seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already in the ground , give the ball a pigment as colour : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the sphere of Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots , and click App@@ ly or press the input button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brightness effect and reflection results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , and hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a 3D scene or model .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ produces the scene in the last saved version , and all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu entry can only be selected , if you have not saved any saved changes in the scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; repe@@ ats the last returned command . this menu entry can only be selected , if you have used Edi@@ ting und@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog , where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and standard behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can use this option pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er , change commands or add new ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually , without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , using an image file as a color card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images can be displayed either in a separate window , in the size of the image or in full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the button Return .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the dialogue setting up - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and Processing and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the keys can be specified for each window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can adjust further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is this point activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already see the next picture in the folder while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set up &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; to set up that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged for large images on the full screen . this option is turned on as default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
determines if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows to the right of the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can change the keyboard short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows great icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shows thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
display the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ editing based on &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos , and perform corrections and changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a dialog with a link . if you are using this , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show photo ; then we would like to encourage you to ask questions about other users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best way to take part is to join the developer mailing list , to join the developer mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; show photo ; try to give as much control over its operations as possible . to access these settings , you need to set the show@@ ring settings in the Settings menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color selected when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of the show@@ room ; has a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images , which no longer makes images to scan and save images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each image you can open a dialog for saving , or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by using the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite , with the command cann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is given , a dialog is opened to select the scanner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel , and cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly treat these options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to scan a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then start scanning for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture is selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when saving a preview in the settings , the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and you will get back to the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the Settings button , the name of the same name is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not requested , then the option must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting allows you to select images . open dialog for each picture opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . when &amp; output , you need to select Save without asking for a file name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the images are saved after each scan , this folder is used as a default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it using the button ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically stored images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically stored picture gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of the time a picture is recorded . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the button Help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; channel ; -@@ Manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; channel ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; used like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ations and their function . the global key short@@ cut can be set up by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... select .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may set up existing multimedia buttons to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok , short commands . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ control center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ line options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not work .
start with require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a basis for your own scripts or simply expand the required functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ OK and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the D@@ CO@@ P command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is mostly used . in this way , D@@ CO@@ P &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; send al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this reason strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should keep track of their standard input and respond accordingly to events . of course a script can also ignore events when there is no use .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to store and store the setup data each script must take care of itself . if a script is started Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played , and the script could now query more information about the new piece using D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , metadata or piece length ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
volum@@ et@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le guides the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to remove an entry you can use D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stop , or if the user stops a script , send &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that can be compressed by a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that can optionally be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . for example the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ o@@ ks script package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the sp@@ elling amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file permission : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wik@@ i scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may have some play@@ lists already , but you can never decide which one you want to listen to ? and if the decision is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , you have to type the following in the basic folder of the Amar@@ ok springs to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; as most applications , it has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; set up without bother@@ ing about the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the playlist , the player window will add a playlist to the playlist . if the option is off , only the playlist window will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . the option turns off the experimental function of the m@@ oods ometer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atmospheric design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . thus , the used color scheme for the tuning bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
storing files in the music files : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if this setting is enabled .@@ mood files are stored on location of the respective music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save play@@ lists when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok . activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the playlist while ending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you activate this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing a piece of a piece , the playlist window pop@@ s up / un@@ roll to keep the current play in the visible window area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when changing the context browser , you automatically switch to the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting your own fonts , the otherwise grey displayed section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the choice of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continue playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will continue with the play at the spot with which it has been stopped at the end of the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the on @-@ screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first option is the font . click &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use your own colors to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not enabled the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ colors are used .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD , allowing the O@@ SD to be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to set , on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop down field , and some drivers enable further adjustments in this card card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and the database of the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this results in &amp; Amar@@ ok , both the crossed as well as their sub@@ folders to the music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected there is still further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l set @-@ up section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : the network port is entered on which the database port is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card last@@ .@@ f@@ m establishes the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send copied pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok , to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar interpreter requests : after activation of this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok will retrieve a list with similar interpreter to the played piece . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; Z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Amar@@ ok needs only the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included in it ) because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; needs some of them ( e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t as they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will make an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file with ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and then you can delete the file and let the collection be created again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , Tag@@ li@@ b crash@@ es when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make sure that all libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash@@ es when editing the met@@ a information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , then disable automatic switch off , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist . use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag ; amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repe@@ ating / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : symbol look@@ up error : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map . please check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this using ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the installation problems are solved by the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter only one error , if something is wrong with the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only a blank playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then , drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to intui@@ tively hold the surface , the startup window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under Extras Statisti@@ cs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to rate pieces the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short @-@ commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ o@@ OK is in the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want to remove , then press release on your keyboard . or click right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist removed from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there , just like you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the addition button , the button playlist will be saved . click on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you probably miss the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . take a look for lib@@ visual ; this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no . yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be what media types support G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / arts / N@@ MM / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may ! perhaps you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default do not include MP3 de@@ co@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so , OK ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . this can be achieved with a hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of this command should help you search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. , sink ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open sound server with highest possible priority ( real time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning - see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia fully to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers , &amp; Amar@@ ok crash@@ es . why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Store the m@@ peg file , compile and install it . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a full list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and use the alarm to execute this command : D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok player play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you &apos;re wo@@ ken up by the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to find the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok , current titles if you are on another computer ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ts and titles of running part : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP D@@ CO@@ P --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ .
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ ali@@ zations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ windows . click on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size modi@@ fiable window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + right mouse button presents a piece in the queue string . by pressing the paste button , the first search result is played and the search returned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the Control Panel ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after starting Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and there are many error messages appearing on the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can edit the review for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can select the review of a piece as well as all other attributes , by right @-@ clicking on the piece . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
developers do not want to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a set release plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ o@@ OK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon while playing animated in general settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . choose settings tool@@ bars , and take the desired changes there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ o@@ OK ... image context browser design , click New Design ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphi@@ cs Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click on the button Settings ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu .
audio c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crash@@ es and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . so the / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer CR@@ IT@@ I@@ CA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking . it is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without rel@@ inqu@@ ishing . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : don &apos;t use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ o@@ OK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ der is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will receive the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ o@@ OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can Amar@@ ok use the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up under settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output the device . typically , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the x@@ ine setup dialog , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sampling rate , channels and so on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not cared for further . you may naturally take this problem yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed coach for Arts : ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok . if you don &apos;t like your collection afterwards or the assistant simply does not like it then you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easier to search for certain pieces . if you are content with the playlist , you can save them with the help of the playlist . you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection , you will find the option to import play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play an audio CD , please select actions audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in the WAV format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio CD function uses the audio audio protocol , and is not compatible with all available drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button , and follow the burning menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sets the installation of some software packages . the packages you need are listed below . in addition , some additional packages that work with &amp; Amar@@ ok will make it more enjoyable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. R@@ PM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a multi@@ faceted multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control as well as any normal multimedia player ; a player window with the most important features . the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and search your entire music collection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok control center . at the top of the window is a running text display showing the current play time , bit rate and sample rate of the current unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , including running text display . you can switch from the available analy@@ zer by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer will be displayed in an independent , enlarged window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below you can see the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL knob activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , volume control and play position slider . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that it does in any other player , but don &apos;t allow yourself to be deter@@ red by the abundance of features , they are all easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context browser displays various information regarding the current part . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows are later explained in detail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window starts to drop . the information presented there are now distributed in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . the information presented in the statistics window can also be viewed ( Extras Statisti@@ cs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sub@@ window music shows information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece and the artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to track the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z database .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the Musi@@ c@@ bra@@ in@@ z icon , you will find more information about the current play . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its valuation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to view cover images in the context browser the artwork must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng will be supported . the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the Recommen@@ ded pieces , the favorite pieces are from this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can choose which information to display in the music sub@@ window , right click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last section , albums of the artist , lists all albums of the current artist you have in your collection . when you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on all pieces in the single areas to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button , and then select one of the ways to add the piece or album to the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using written scripts . if you don &apos;t run a text script , you can choose which to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required to do so .
the Search opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing interpreter - only groups the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to see compil@@ ations or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing interpreter / year - Album - Sor@@ ted to interpreter and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - Alb@@ um@@ name will be related . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted each other , the interpreter will be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces are first sorted by genre , including the artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group@@ ing genre / interpreter / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album underneath the interpreter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the last button , you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you have something on the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this might take a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directly below the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves in the list view , as well as in the tree view . notes on how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are various time slots available , ranging from the last 24 hours to one year . you can also select your total collection , which makes the filter practically shut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load - This cle@@ ars the current playlist , and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attach to playlist - Ad@@ ds the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on one entry , you will reach the same effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set pieces in queue - this feature adds the selected pieces into the queue , so you will play it next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
save as a playlist ... Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces into the queue for transfer to the Media Player . for more details , see the Media Player section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; burn all pieces of this artist / Bur@@ n CD - Bur@@ sting the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and fired either as a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for piece information , and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( n ) Move files in the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . when you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mark the list - Select the selected album as a compilation , as a result it will appear among various interpre@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up compilation marking - change an album marked as a compilation , back into a normal album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playlist browser makes handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the intelligent play@@ lists . these features &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection which have never been played .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even created intelligent play@@ lists are possible . click on the Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod you have to locate the pieces on your iPod to interpreter sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . by doing so , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not correspond to your search criteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now , you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachments of the Shift key can be tricky . in this case , the holding of the shift key can be useful automatically at the end of the list and not on the mouse position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the playlist contains all the pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply typing the entries by mouse to the desired location . to reset the filter you will only press the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter you will press the back button until the text field is empty again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries one , two and three . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , one or two or three ( or combination ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with ge@@ ese @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you specify a particular search column you can search for larger or smaller ones . for example : review : &gt; 50 . this search for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bad . this search for all the pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order click on the entries . the number matches the order in which the pieces are played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback control and volume control . you can set up the buttons shown on the menu and set up tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking on the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a play in this playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces were played recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for information on writing your own scripts , please refer to the Scrip@@ ts section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Visu@@ alization plugin dialog is used to enable available visu@@ ali@@ zations in &amp; Amar@@ ok . the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this quick guide will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps , you need to create an audio CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a dialog box , where you can select which files you want to burn to CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compression formats , keep in mind that you will receive a poor quality audio CD , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this dialog box , you can &apos;t do anything . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a l@@ ousy installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level , for example , to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to an unpleasant effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a convenient method to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . a click on an entry opens the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file Save .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes the current project . if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; includes all open projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , just as if you have called for any project file shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closes all open projects and finishes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for every un@@ saved project , you &apos;ll be asked what to do so as if you have called a file shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . the only difference can be opened when the project already contains data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is the ? -@@ aid ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD @-@ project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session are always included in the current project . it is useful for you to view files from a previous session . it is intended for you rather than help so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . this function removes no files from the media , it only hides the previously imported files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create an image from a CD which you would like to burn later . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can also only create an image from a DVD using the copying dialog , so the medium must be large enough to record the total ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned instantly by pressing the burning button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog window will usually appear after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even options for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided that a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in the folder view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head@@ line is a narrow area , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this opens a dialog window to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key mapping below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you will need to enter the system administrator password when you start the wizard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b should work . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with an &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use the D@@ CO@@ P command line , you can either use the D@@ CO@@ P command line program or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the D@@ CO@@ P command line utility . to make use of the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
d@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) void format@@ d@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can get a project on the command line using the # D@@ CO@@ P k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :

&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reader for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on en@@ coder installed on the machine .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in wa@@ v files on the hard drive ) and by many coding files that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( these coding packages have to be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a second step , these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , it has to be done now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is probably not necessary to install anything by yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a word for copying protected audio CDs ; s : as said before &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from CD &amp; CD ; read it . in any case you can &apos;t copy the copy protection mechanisms ; do not even avoid the copy protection mechanisms . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CDs ; s !
while setting up only one needs to be done ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration ) is explained afterwards . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; convert into many formats - depending on which code programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is just a short list of the main window commands . here , for example , more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starts the C@@ DD@@ B inquiry of the CD data according to the creation of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be made . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start reading and , when an en@@ coder is configured in the Settings dialog in the setup directory , encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file will be selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the setup dialog to configure the way noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens the main dialog box of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ coder ) . you need to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes sound quality , coding and compression rates and helps you choose the correct encoding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ GG enjoys an easy advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ b@@ ps ) , but the differences are less important because both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , it is still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license issues &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; + High to very high sound quality ( with high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play@@ sets is present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto @-@ stereo systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people , and most of the music &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps V@@ BR compression rate up to 6.@@ 3 . needs up to 320 k@@ b@@ ps for complex pieces of music and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR compression rate approx . 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ b@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate of about 11 128 k@@ b@@ ps for all pieces of a title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; --@@ pres@@ et ins@@ ane &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ b@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded from the fre@@ ed@@ b through the internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . they can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the coding explain the switch for these programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example to add title to the key words ( English : day ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with lame the switch -@@ t@@ t of lame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can download the audio CDs , so that everyone else can download this information instead of themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translation : that &apos;s the author ) I &apos;m not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively selecting a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when calling the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the computers .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org supplies a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information on reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( typically created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from CD &amp; CD ; in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; those who want to know more precisely are searching in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not been done yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to save the read WAV files , the encoding and the desired file format can be selected . for the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries are available for advertisement ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution , before the en@@ coder can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing a coding a further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; you want to read it . to do so , check the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time and read everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for lame can be found with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have access to it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first section covers the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably only be done once and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for any read &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here we determine the code for compression of the music ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ b@@ ps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . because we are lazy we share the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to download data from the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it every time you read a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the device name is handed over to the reading program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present there is a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the box card General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please select only for incomplete information , so that you will be informed when information is missing to create keywords ( tags ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card @-@ card CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the computer must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server , while reading the &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD is found ; this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory name / file name or tag entries , you can easily ren@@ ame the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aside from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be obtained ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as a first attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls boot the protocol 88@@ 80 , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
simply take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one drive at the same time ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD ; after read out of the last piece , tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be given the path / folder where the file is not enabled . if the field is not enabled , the files will not be created in the private folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned earlier this is a setting for very good audio quality even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.@@ 3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; entry for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted on demand . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set the rest , as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; number of concur@@ rent WAV files : with dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it is possible to en@@ code more than a WAV file at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is it , we have just finished the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you will never need to change it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this section we describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; we will create MP3 files . we will create a connection to the Internet as we are comfortable and the CD ; the process of the fre@@ ed@@ b is described .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as we have a &amp; CD ; use which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained from fre@@ ed@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example , it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this hasn &apos;t happened yet , now the CD must be pushed into the drive defined in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is not done , please refer to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section pertaining to the basic settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not have the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger the first button in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data , and the title of the first piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Current title &apos; and the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; input field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; Current title &apos; input field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the commentary box of the album will be used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : after the successful recall of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with upper@@ case letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any un@@ desirable comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and to only 28 characters for the comment field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . in the help of a kos@@ her , look for more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more information , go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD editor &apos;s window appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the next line in the main window , and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attention : this window does not appear , if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown on the piece list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles are selected in such a way , or press the All Pi@@ ps button on the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at one time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting the selection process by clicking on the selected button , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the entries and track what is going on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on the tab to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read out on the hard drive , the status of the program is displayed in the bottom panel of the window in the status bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this error message will you see if you are trying to work with a coder that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces which have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder is not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the order 1 reads the first piece . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . this means reading and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window . it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that appears configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . the computer used with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneously reading and encoding ( though two different pieces ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is en@@ coded and a third order is en@@ coded with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . respectively 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is included . if you read this , you probably already have done it ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to suit your needs , the following is correct for you : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a program that calls many different programs has many options . best read the step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the initial start of the program , without any indication of how it will proceed from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive ) , or from the unusually short menu ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is it ? who reads this , has probably already started the program . it should look like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange , if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these informations , but ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also several properties that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system and should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is required for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the song text on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel , by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events , text events ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sitting support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the l@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also create a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . this also works with several songs simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the Play pick from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid plays a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and driving with the regulator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the template and adjust the playback speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button Pause or the selection of the menu entry break in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tual event and others use lyrics and again some of them . some pieces do not have text : - )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will automatically be determined by the kar@@ aoke text . you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to set an event type , select text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summari@@ ze , which will be played in a row . this section shows how you can use collections efficiently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a collection , open the collection manager first . find this in the Menu Collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New and enter the name for the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . at the beginning , the collection will contain the same songs as the original ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the desired one in the collection manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection will be released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song using the button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting Automatic addition to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when automatic add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied at opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces that are opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the menu collections of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you add or delete songs , or select random order in the menu , the order is re @-@ defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , select the next song from the menu item or hit the key arrow on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to boun@@ ce back a song , select the Previous piece button , select the previous item from the menu item or press the key arrow left . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events translate into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and therefore always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only have one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI Map because all sound cards are compatible GM ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices etc . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file , which saves all necessary changes for playing a piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id ( see below ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ ONS ... EN@@ D
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ ONS ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support may be for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you will see how the patches from General MIDI are displayed on your specific keyboard . general use looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the left side of the sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your keyboard for example does not support a gun ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that here with the term drum patch of the patch it is a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can define several Key@@ maps for each channel and every instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ maps are used primarily to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel , for example , see the included key@@ maps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , do this easily in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio is calculated in which pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n it is used with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is needed because GM announces that there is a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI Map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards , you see what sounds are being played . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Per@@ se@@ wer View menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pace @-@ LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accept , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , activate automatic add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD , to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo you can double @-@ click on the LCD . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve opened on a &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop an &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or stit@@ ched ( if I play a MIDI file ) just go to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to listen to a file just quick , without adding them to a collection , turn off the auto Add to collection , and the new file will add to the temporary collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ S.@@ . first you only want to play the first file . so set the setting Automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ D. . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Má@@ laga . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies but I try to program MIDI files and prove music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question of making a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy you write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I &apos;ll get in touch with friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , and I would like to emphasize that I only write further because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - fixing the error that pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my thanks also apply Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul WIT@@ TA , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and of course , my thanks also apply to all those excellent musicians on the net that give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and Kar@@ aoke files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to this can be found on his homepage , which is located on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; you have to compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it works as if you had a sound card apart from that you cannot hear music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you encounter problems , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ end ; was not finished yet , and installed on this computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . when you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / apps / C@@ M@@ Player file can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the play@@ lists from the menu and select either the edit mode or select another category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected , without comparison with the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; file the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .@@ x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .@@ x@@ ml ; the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animation during start @-@ ups does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can therefore stop the application a second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; smil@@ ot ; &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / home / / / home / / / home / / / home / / / home / / / home / / / / / / / / / / ; /
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path can be set from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the &apos; console &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here , the output of mp@@ layer is shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything has to be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . here &apos;s an example of how a flash can be played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be past@@ ed in the custom field , embed YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so that the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages need the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file Direc@@ tions of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there are no errors the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console or console from the context menu ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , using manual change of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , this must be done with manual change of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player is the dialog in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . the encoding must be fi@@ gured out ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) ; the correct name probably has a dv@@ d in it .
because the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be supported in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source , source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are there instructions on how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter , if I play off it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to run as user root after the device is inserted . it is absolutely certain to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , why must my CPU be checked for performance every time ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ ed@@ . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ le ;
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional sc@@ roll@@ ment application . Unix @-@ like systems will probably be used on the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these components can be included in the &amp; Linux ; distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ Project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions , these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ Website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual is for everyone - independent of the experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ; &amp; Linux ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation should be taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is required , the contact should be made via the box ; -@@ Website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ ste , or if expan@@ sions are requested , this should be addressed to the ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about Po@@ sters ; and to experience the possibilities , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start working there directly with reading the chapter work with the editor of Po@@ sters ; begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is difficult to use La@@ y @-@ TECH . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the last name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : Docum@@ ent Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduction includes at least the command \ \ &apos; s class , the body starts with the command \ \ &apos; begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the quick entry assistant to &amp; ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document Cl@@ asses : this sets the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; scroll &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; scroll &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , Projec@@ tor &#91; &#91; scroll &#93; , Movie &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
encoding : this is used to set the character encoding . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ x should be known ( for correct processing of &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for and latex ; for the integration , they only need to be selected in the check box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the Docum@@ ents of Kom@@ a Script ( compl@@ ying with German DIN regulations ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new users don &apos;t have to worry about this , just a short description of the functions and further information about it will be given in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of used commands , settings and elements ( as well as inappropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le it is possible that some mathematical environment is not closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) , this function can be created ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the menu box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex , allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( saving the most common and sub@@ stan@@ tive element ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; ger@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent File ) &#93; is created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the appropriate line in &amp; latex ; -@@ Source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font , and besides PDF , there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you are looking for a query the elements of the DVI ; file are used with the editor and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked . the selection is the exact opposite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work with other embedded .@@ tex files is simplified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quick @-@ build : the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is applied to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be created . the first selection box is designed for fast integration of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the More is available for items such as keywords , notes , notes or references . the available options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover : used for reference to a specified term ( selection , possible ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ± e is used for determining the font sizes . the font sizes can be specified for the main text , the fusion notes , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and defining the settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses according to the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font number . if the font name is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the volume of construction or the quick @-@ build . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the source code must be stored in front of comp@@ iling . &amp; box , for saving the storage automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the compilation of the document fails , the protocol should be searched after the errors . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example a report with the font list e 12 is created and only a few people shall have a different font . the command \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the changes are covered only within the environment ( from \ \ start { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many options to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , fat print , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc . , either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
\ \ Start { emp@@ h } : this command is for c@@ ital@@ ics and is until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ value : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ &apos; start { ratio } and ends with \ \ end { ratio } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; latex ; definition language is presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box follows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , a few adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be returned to the Editor again ( with internal viewer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; the same steps are needed for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step , after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DVI ; -@@ file to other formats . once the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code was created , the conversion can begin by sn@@ apping into the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default search allows direct jump from the editor to the added position inside the DVI ; file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . to do this , only Modern will need to set up boxes ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to choose the selection , the poin@@ ter must be cli@@ cked in a line of the source code and then click on for selection . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this function in &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; open and go to the appropriate line . to do this &amp; box ; in &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; set in &amp; oc@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece set up ... Editor )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should an error occur when using the Quick @-@ build of the &amp; DVI ; if an error occurs , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the log file records the source of errors in the source text . in the editor you can see the errors of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . to view the error line must be cli@@ cked on the error in logging and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when cli@@ cked on the button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard for the rapid creation of a new document . further information can be found in the section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ¤ user of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file has to be opened or a new file created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , some strings have to be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings box ... Settings General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings will be replaced by what variables : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be sub@@ stituted by entering the document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ &apos; s class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest way to create a template is using the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , the following steps must be performed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a template can be created from any kind of latex ; -@@ files created . in a simple way to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; Po@@ sters ; as an internal editor . &amp; Po@@ unds ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and raising of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many options for edi@@ cs can be made directly from &amp; ki@@ le .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to learn more about posters ; and to experience the possibilities , the manual should be used to Kate . users of &amp; ki@@ le can start reading the chapter work with the editor of Po@@ sters ; begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called by La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that clicking the \ \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par \ par is selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse and highlight the most diverse types of source texts . for example , the / latex differs ; -@@ commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many assistants can add additional jumping marks . this is a special type of book@@ mark inside the text . the menus edit jumps or the respective keys . thereby , this jump token is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; . although &amp; makes ; excellent features have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; -@@ Source tex@@ tes are added to the selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex , commands and all other lines of the source code . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this selection has an extended meaning as well , since this command also has an extended meaning ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed can be removed by pressing the key . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility . see Rem@@ ove the following commands to read the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le offers ; for more commands in the editing environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , the current environment is inj@@ ected ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to set the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } , it is spra@@ yed to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the overview can quickly be lost . this command locks the last modified environment , so that the ne@@ sted ambient structure will not be destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups , which are determined by clips { ... } . among the Edit Te@@ X Group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , the current group will jump ( no matter where the current position is ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this command , the current group will jump ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ v@@ ature clasp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the cur@@ sor is in front of or behind the cur@@ led clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the other end of the group will jump ( or vice versa ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when entering many ne@@ sted group clas@@ ps , the overview can quickly be lost . this command locks the most recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not destroyed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; latex , two simple suits are used . for the purpos@@ eful implementation , the sign is used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this automatic entry of the double license plate can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X , switched on and off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. , native or French ) and therefore German or French suits . there are also many other languages available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when shifting shift ; enter key &amp; box , an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , it is not just a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a spread@@ sheet environment , including t &amp; box , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex , - or user @-@ defined environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some users want to order the columns in tables -@@ environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) ; try &amp; box ; after the next tab in the above line . even though this tab is not the matching tab for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; Po@@ sters ; already having a good source code completion has been added in &amp; box ; three different modes have been added . three of them work as required and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways of working under the boxes ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; begin { environment } , &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the press key is pressed , the last letter of the input is removed and , by this way , the list can be sc@@ aled down by entering another letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , by selecting a command , a jump to these positions can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ le ; you can set up settings to these lists . there can be different options for &amp; tex , - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as suggestions of general language use can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must always enter a few characters with \ \ \ &apos; . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for res@@ izing the surroundings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when calling for full stop mode over the men@@ ue or the key Alt + Shift key Space , the command to open the environment automatically starts and it appears \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this is done , the environment will be closed automatically . as soon as &amp; box ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Settings box ; set up ... ki@@ le ; you can set up settings to these lists . this mode uses the list of options for &amp; tex , - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lists can be set up under Settings box ... as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the file L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the letter L is typ@@ ed and the word all@@ otted shut@@ down or the single C@@ tr@@ l + Alt space bar is introduced , the character L will be replaced by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big j@@ ars are not helpful for automatic execution . however , it has been established that many people in a document are written more than once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this mode can be set up in the Men@@ le Settings ... boxes can be de@@ ported . here , the threshold for the display of res@@ titu@@ tion can also be determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / dresser / the Persian home folder . mode is for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) and Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to view the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but they offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to view the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the building tools are grouped together in the menus to compile , create conver@@ sions and create a view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 . afterwards the DVI ; file can be converted into a PS file using Alt ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the quick @-@ build command is used , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window is opened every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... here , the following information is requested for the project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the script function of &amp; box , allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code@@ cs . the scripts can be administered via scripts in the vertical bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the API scripts are not yet fin@@ alized yet , and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it must be said that the development environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; latex ; is a well @-@ developed system , in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; box ; provides a lot of different help to support users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ly@@ ex ; and &amp; Tex@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . therein , a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather it is ideal for a specific format@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the Fin@@ den of the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application of tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database of all documents and for a graphical display .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the big advantage is the search for package names or keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double @-@ click with the mouse , or the space bar opens the viewer for the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . using the command line interface you can create random signature signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for day signatures , the same signature is read from &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures create unique emails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to create a new signature select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this will save you an empty signature ; in the section Sig@@ natur@@ es . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it with C@@ tr@@ l ; s file Save or click on the Save flo@@ ppy disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails private or professional there are always enough signatures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then select Del@@ ete from the File menu or click the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new short@@ wave by pressing the button or key combination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature from the output of a command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking on a call @-@ up entry in the shown list , the cur@@ sor will be transferred to the corresponding file name number in the main window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains a lot of new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools are used as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known my pro@@ c and how awesome it is . do we cancel it yet another piece , we give it a graphical interface ! simply click on the icon for the XML processor and you &apos;re done ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application expects an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folder and enter the desired folder in the folder of other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted each time , when it is started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said before , everyone who worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is open , simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , then let the current file be checked . if not , delete the file with current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click Well @-@ formed check selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( external ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG examination is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by using the other file selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have been named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plug @-@ ins which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; la@@ det to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves may benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not wait until someone builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plu@@ gins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this dialog allows you to manage all the plug @-@ ins , and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can enter the search path . when adding plu@@ gins without a location , and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to search the plug @-@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members , and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one member can have multiple roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub @-@ project leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the user can look for himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by looking out the team member from the list and clicking on the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after which they are : text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations , for further information on notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leader when something happens . see in for more detailed information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of a message when a file is backed up or the sending of a message when a file is saved or a script that introduces a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the site event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can create , edit and delete events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees in the add@@ res@@ see list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader , see how to set up such leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ann@@ ot@@ ation is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a commentary area , followed by text text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comments can be sent to a defined member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is part of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nick@@ names and roles names are sp@@ elling independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around brackets and tags : make the note invalid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , the DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supported web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description of the other can be found in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta ... called . this dialog extends over a number of pages , which are treated consec@@ u@@ tively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion , it can be changed . the entries are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great / Small sp@@ elling of tags : large / lower case of automatically inserted tags . normal sized / lower case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great / Small sp@@ elling of attributes : large / lower case of automatically added attributes . normal sp@@ elling means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional tags : when requested , it is added for tags for which the closing day is optional , and inserted immediately after the item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not include optional tags : as above for any other tags , except for the simple tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automatic update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automatic translation of accent marks : controls the automatic conversion of accentu@@ ated characters in the corresponding encoding during typing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard button , the default settings can be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in a different way than with file open opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is executed by the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not detected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; periodically created backup copies , so that a backup can be restored at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the window settings to the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface has been modified by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depending on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning message area will be used to control the display of warnings by hooks , by default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source file view in shared mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here the Par@@ ser and the structural tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in detail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of a mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of structural tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be automatically opened when editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened . empty no@@ des are empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s may be valid for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plug @-@ ins can be managed by the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications of third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , the most well known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; address : the path to the plugin , if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input : this information is given to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read mode &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled then test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the plug @-@ in is correct even if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment but it will be installed later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , the bug was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented which allows various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ l ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger in the project settings . with the options dialog next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin sel@@ ector , the specific settings can be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; interface : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view that displays the content of monitored variables , usually appears in the left dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears at the bottom of the dock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown , usually appears in the bottom of the Do@@ ck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this action , the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gger claims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the counter to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger , or termin@@ ates listening to requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sends a HTTP request to the server to de@@ duce a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bu@@ gger requirement has started , the script will start with the request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , without entering into the functions or include . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , but if possible in functions and include it will be corrected correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one , as if there were not the current ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or set to a new value of a variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work of Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can help , better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages and &amp; CSS ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; easy to use and productive for web developers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the tag folder and the tool@@ bar . tag directory contains two file types , the tag folder and the tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tag XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog ; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; itself . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they only contain the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following chapter describes each element in detail , and everything about the possibilities and boundaries is explained in a simple way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type above itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tag type is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only Family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class , where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only Family 1 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an only element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only once exist for each attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog , and attribute @-@ tree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P . the D@@ CO@@ P interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = D@@ CO@@ P and the name of an interface . the D@@ CO@@ P method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; requires source = D@@ CO@@ P , a ker@@ f and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ ame % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a container tag that groups together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an only element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. once for each item ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each field ; att@@ r &gt; and lt ; label &gt; tag ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements , which may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a day , this element is an only element type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all Tag@@ XML files must begin with an &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break@@ age but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this function is currently not available . currently , the check only takes place when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following , an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &gt; / lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DT@@ D &apos;s DT@@ D settings . this allows di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = verb 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D specification . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as a nick@@ name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an action can set up actions with Settings ... created . click New action , leading to the same dialog : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this action assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a key short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the Det@@ ai@@ ded Settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text will be inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can start external applications ( usually scripts ) that change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : sh / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; % f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs the text will be unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used by the external script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document , or the path to the project file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable usually only makes sense with this setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default output , can be specified by setting the value to the output box : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fill out all necessary fields , and add the day to the appropriate tool bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan its use , enable dialog &quot; edit tag &quot; when available so that an input when using the action is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ig@@ am ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? then we replace it , before we have difficulty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; Menu ; , Graphi@@ c More Program@@ s ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edi@@ ting size to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note that the created symbol is not only useful for you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually appear as los , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ alled a message to the user that clicking this symbol will be inserted ; -@@ tag in the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after creating the symbol , it has to be connected with the action . this is done through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are some , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions for tool@@ bar or it should be assigned to a better overview by some divi@@ ders in several groups . set the tool@@ bar set up dialog on Settings tool@@ bars . make sure the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note how the tren@@ ner supports group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar couldn &apos;t believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , button on the opposite of the Start button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by ma@@ sturb@@ ating all symbols , to make sure everything works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after new XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting your own documentation , you might be able to check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory whether someone has done it for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = basic syntax is ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and , consequently , at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be displayed ! ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
space characters do not affect anything but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files will be replaced .
the contents section is the section of the context @-@ sensitive help section . for example when writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a simple list of separate context items that are supposed to be available ( for &amp; PHP ) , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just to $ HO@@ ME / / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / apps / Qu@@ anta / do@@ c for local or global use . then create a folder ( just as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
if you are sure that these are well and worth sharing send your do@@ cr@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else who are sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , the input fields must be empty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bars , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , check &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is possible to work on XML languages currently not written by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and converting a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , is written in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that will appear in the ! doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global elements are stored for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local elements are a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ box , the building man@@ sions , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document pass@@ able , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execute CVS commands to the current document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click in the editing pane leads to another context menu related to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the text under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , when the string is named a file under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional are used as standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. , P@@ GT ; in your document , you can enter the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill out different fields in a dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building man@@ sions ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate and navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
templates can be divided into three categories depending on what connection they are used . global templates are always available ; local templates are always available for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking on the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script . for example , click on the right mouse button to edit , edit , or send email . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the document to the position of the element . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with it , you can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application @-@ oriented entry system allows you to change all available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the complete documentation of the web @-@ technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can be downloaded from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site can be edited and edited and viewed by adding a folder do@@ c to a project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed by useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tab shows all errors in the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . they show on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive by &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE desktop . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now , this would make him the absolutely greatest Web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well up to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ) . this can increase productivity dramatically . by the program Kom@@ ats@@ it can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any scrip@@ ting language tax . ( click here for more information . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development , and quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version , and produced a commercial program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ ett Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as M@@ anti@@ a am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest record is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . if you attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts special characters to &amp; HTML , when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
converts the text from cli@@ p@@ board to &amp; URL ; en@@ ro@@ lment which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn on or off the block selection , allowing you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very helpful , if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are displayed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts , and the de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switching and switching the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as you change to the structure tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forecasts or next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects will be saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . then , the selected files will then be copied to the project directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add them to the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( Ki@@ o slaves ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings , like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are explained in detail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : locally or project .
create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings actions ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you have not yet saved the tool@@ bar , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; allows the upload of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone can access them . see in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; which you or anyone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities out of the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not available the store fails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the tool@@ bar currently loaded . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ men@@ ue menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this entry is always present in the tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently it only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed below the menu items mentioned above . click on them . clicking on an activated plug @-@ in will be disabled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the font list mode for the current file . the list of available template schemes is based on posters , versions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Mac@@ intosh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may occasionally need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the map mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode that corresponds to the presentation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . when selecting a entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
switches the status bar to the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the changes in this dialog include any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; judge the behavior of the editor window , in the documentation of posters ; find details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or add which ones and change sequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this should create a help in the context of the mouse cur@@ sor , but is not implemented yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , e.g. after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name , file is automatically filled out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.@@ g f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ i.@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where the templates are saved for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files , or entire folders can be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . if you have a server side script ( e.g. , PHP ; , Python , etc . ) you have to proceed differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a project is started anew from scratch , if a project is started anew from scratch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to good man@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the menu with project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or changed with the Key Shift ; F@@ 7 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some settings correspond to those in the project assistant , and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which will be ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more about project views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in , the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set using the Options button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set up in the profile window , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by pointing out its own tree view for each profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sub @-@ window Team configurations , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event configuration window , event actions can be switched on and add or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specified event occurs , such as the backup of a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can &apos;t be influenced at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to open another project select Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as enlargement .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project supervision provides free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folder beha@@ ves as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... in the right mouse button of the context menu : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is only one profile , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten by the program . this option is useful when frequent upload of files is needed and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will stop the transfer , or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the name of the server on which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name , or an IP address function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; views can be accessed , opened or deleted in the project tool@@ bar project or project tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to the own working method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars are st@@ alt@@ able in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best handled by the tool@@ bars menu . the addition of tool@@ bars is explained below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the icons can be set up either using context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , and other actions such as tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where it can be indicated which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and Settings actions can be set .. set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; templates are basically like a common file system with extended organisation and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you set for the file system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some templates supplied with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set at the beginning of each template , prior to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . binary templates are usually available in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; documents can be written by any text document . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on the templates tree .
as the name says these templates are used for whole sites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; create a document structure according to exposure ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File In Save As Local Tem@@ plate .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once this has happened , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select text in your document and click on File As a template store selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily drawn with dra@@ gging and laying on tree view templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can click on a folder in the file tree or in the project file to create a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented procedure . you can create he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or link dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , paste files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / app@@ liqu@@ or apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as explained above .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is bl@@ ended as soon as el@@ ong@@ ated attributes are inherited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a root folder is set in such a way , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text brick . if nothing appears , the b@@ lah would probably be located in a root folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could be general he@@ aders and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project , allowing a whole presentation to be provided with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers for copying content templates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; &amp; V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second is sharing the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made are visible in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains a small green icon the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor to edit . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit it . there are no plans to change this behavior .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; Editor is active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to another , where the position is maintained in the document . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the synchron@@ ization gap between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor are adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; Editor is created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows key words on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating the look of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . editing CSS rules is not currently supported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to include an external CSS Style template , by clicking on the file @-@ open button and selecting the corresponding file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cur@@ sor can be used as usual . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor will behave as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the insertion of tags is done in the same way through the tool bar , as in the source text editor . note that inser@@ ting tags already existing identical tags will not be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some tool@@ bars , such as the tables wizard or the lists assistant , are de@@ activated later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to other style sheets , the search for specific elements is possible and the style of the style can be followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml that are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a path name . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded style default file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .@@ x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this command , it is checked to a part or entire agreement with a default name named QNAP or a given mode name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . after the start of each run , it is automatically checked again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with Re@@ ad@@ line library installed , you can scroll the arrow keys to / from the previously executed commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several commands require more than one argument . quote characters can be used to commit compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; an argument is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; .
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name such as &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or cy@@ g@@ win systems the name can have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ AT@@ H : a path to change the working folder . on some operating systems , the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data : the XML @-@ data , or the XML document edited by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ BLE ; and lt ; U@@ RI@@ B ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; running time commands : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit } , step , Step@@ Up , Step@@ down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many graphical tools for comparing . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time changed the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program used by me only showed the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merging of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; tre@@ mol@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ value file browser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
3 @-@ way merge is also fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on one piece of code and make changes to the result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps with comparing and merging complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; Fig@@ .3 , in the folder mer@@ ges : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and follow the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check Ko@@ de frequently , you will like this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make it easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
folder 2 Fol@@ der 2 diff@@ 3 folder 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 1 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 2 Fol@@ der 3 -@@ o target folder
the Open dialog allows you to manually type file names to select a file browser ( file ... ) or select a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , a folder is used for B and C however a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to set an output file immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here , you can set options before starting / merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialogue you don &apos;t have to select files , you can close the dialog with the break button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use drag and drop , simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparative window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently , you can pull out nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out only the drop of text into a comparison window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copying and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that the path to a file is too long , then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three spring windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these Pre@@ ferences can be changed by the Settings menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a difference is detected , you can see the color which is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflict in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line change is enabled , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an information line with the inscription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; when editing the result . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the sprin@@ kler buttons to find next resolved conflicts ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only two comparative windows are used , each difference must be solved manually at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows the group belonging to the line will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and maybe select another source . this text does not appear in the final file , or in a marking that you may copy and paste anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : when selecting the sources the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , end , string beginning and string end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the display window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inserted button , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is insertion mode . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the section , and the edi@@ table output window ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference to the next / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up / Str@@ g @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture up@@ side / Str@@ g @-@ picture downward ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy the mark to cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l insertion ) . however , the option selection is automatically copied to cli@@ p@@ board and manual copying is om@@ itted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
line ends are stored in line with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ \ r \ r \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files ; therefore you should not use binary files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically , and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colours could not be available in their pure form but would be ast@@ ert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab character is inserted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically applied to the next line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board then is om@@ itted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save , the default value is the commonly used option on the used operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second step compar@@ es white characters . in this step , white characters will not be ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some editors ( on some systems ) store a car back character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line but then they may be treated with different sizes in page @-@ to @-@ side comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the outcome of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters are less important in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . for details , refer to documentation for the directory comparison and merge operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if there is already such a backup file with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modify the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit and restart and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is global via the control center . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the top setting will be used for all entries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above the selection fields for encoding , a short notice appears what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely informal character for you . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customize the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable can even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used for saving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded over@@ see column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines , just drag the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrange the comparison boxes next to each other , or overl@@ apping each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default names for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command first . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is to give users greater flexibility when setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users don &apos;t want to program it themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
use this pre @-@ processing command for line sync to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ) converts the found text in upper@@ case .
the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line deviations . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Any sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit .
sometimes you may want to perform multiple replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; &apos; use to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever you only need some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires only ( and ) without the &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and merging , and subsequent operations only alter the data that the line @-@ like algorithm performs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : in rare cases , when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ off pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge complete folders in a folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; makes a proposal for each object to merge , and you can adjust the proposal before the start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; can simulate the merge and show the simulated changes , without actually performing them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line , or in the file dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder is specified , &amp; diff@@ 3 , folder 3 is used as target folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry , or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when scanning the folder is complete , displays &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each file and every folder that was found during the scan , is displayed in a tree . you can select an object with a simple click of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - clicking on the + / - clicking on the object or clicking the arrow keys for left / right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) , these types are possible : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries varies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; folders are considered identical , if their entire content is identical . then also folders have the same color . in folders the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the destination if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : contradictory file types . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : contradictory file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the synchron@@ ization mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied &amp; diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then check out an error message : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not removed , merging the folders cannot be started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when merging , a file is processed after another . the Status column shows Fer@@ tig , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected happened . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is OK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the file comparison method is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will show more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or O@@ ber ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the combined actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please note : if you haven &apos;t specified a destination folder , it will be used as destination in the three @-@ folder merge mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only execute the current entry : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid cohesi@@ on actions , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . they can then select a valid action for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window will pop up with the options , simulate , and cancel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without really changes , and you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue directory merge , or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if some entries were individually merged , these entries will not be merged again . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ format@@ ted files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems a preceding point is selected . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for links to files : when the option is disabled , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the option is enabled the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; tre@@ mol@@ 3 ; not for possible recur@@ sions ) . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in an endless loop and crash@@ es . ) This option is disabled in default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ sample . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you compare large folders about a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the trust of the modification date . no real comparison is made . the files are considered identical if they are equal to size . for example , this can be useful when copying the modification date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if two folders are compared and no target folder is specified , the two folders are saved in this mode . the results from merging files are saved in both folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action instead of merging . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is checked in any case . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not just the merging of entire folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the folder mer@@ ges view will be visible while merging individual files . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch off the main window in the menu and switch between directory and text window between the two views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may also want to merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder , and the file will not merge again if you run the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this status is lost , however , if you re @-@ read the directory : list menu : re @-@ inv@@ enting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of Ki@@ o slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders that are located on local or remote hosts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server , and the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a URL has a different syntax than local files , and folders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a path can be relative und@@ one . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of restrictions : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or it cannot be distinguished if a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the date of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ dence of Size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 please press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is used as a part , &amp; tre@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when &amp; k@@ ett@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it supports only the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ part mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by di@@ gest@@ ing into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way , or going to go this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you compiled the program from the sources and the configure script probably didn &apos;t tell the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default install configure in / usr / local but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only one non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create a separate file format that could store this information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effort was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been left , and the text cannot be deleted . what does it mean and how can this be removed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose . to do so , please use another editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . many thanks !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all functions of &amp; K@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the source package .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should not have any problems while comp@@ iling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copies to cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ sch@@ alt insertion ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current marking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore also not in the destination folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in the current program version , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will be dis@@ continued in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result pane ( if the lines are already present ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in default , this option is disabled . leave messages in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumbnail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , stop them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as for several . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops , as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context menu will depend on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the context menu has to be cli@@ cked and the entries are minim@@ ized .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is enabled , the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tick this field lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is shown together with name , the names will be provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty areas will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally it is known as p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a vertical line which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , and then set @-@ up sel@@ ector buttons ... make settings appear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ er@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not have a write permission for the file you have to register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you have to assign the key win@@ dow@@ ed mode and assign it to that value . possible values are :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the default settings &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively you can &amp; K@@ mag ; to make a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the selection box mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter to the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you additionally press the Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the top left corner of the drop @-@ down window remains permanently and only the lower right corner is moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save into a file , insert into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting or stopping the update of the display , stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and reduction &amp; etc . . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen zoom . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen you can use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter persi@@ sts for a while at the same location . it is meant to help people who feel pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain .
to make it clear even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused when clicking with the mouse it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic auxiliary materials : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; supervis@@ es your mouse movements and execute a mou@@ sec@@ lick as soon as you stop the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move the mouse , wait for the end of the movement until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this residence time must pass after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mou@@ sec@@ lick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shooting field is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . this function returns a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads to a double @-@ click . this moves will be changed in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time they can be changed later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to Sound &amp; Multimedia , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is selected , will be started &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set all settings to the values set up when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent reloc@@ ation should be turned off first . if you then have become accustomed to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the intelligent reloc@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response time of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click stays without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the ball , you need to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent reloc@@ ation in this case , this means that &amp; c@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , using another window manager and move a window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solution for this problem is that you can carry out a single mou@@ sec@@ lick . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor over where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to use a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to work with the intelligent moving , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intelligent moving is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very comfortable to mark it in the cli@@ p@@ board and again insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board .
do not use the intelligent sliding when you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use text instead : execute a mou@@ sec@@ lick at one end of the text area and press the Shift key while moving the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this way it is time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . that should be the case on most systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available , if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor remains . this program was developed for people who are suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes the stu@@ n pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a drag process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &amp; k@@ mouth program , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose sentences from a list with the conversation course to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will later be used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second page , select the standard text mess@@ aging book . you can often choose text passages from the text passages without having to type them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) , select the dictionary for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your pro@@ positions ( the bottom white field in the screen shot ) and a channel memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the input field , you can enter the sentences you want to hear . you can choose pro@@ positions that are to be spoken again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , setting up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog includes two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , page word completion as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the field of the learning flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to enter the language generator . in the drop down field below the input field , specify the character encoding with which text is passed to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box , if the text will remain unchanged as standard input to the language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passages menu or in the bar for text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the selection of So@@ fort , the chosen text passage is directly spoken and added to the input box . with the selection of In the input field , the chosen text passage is first entered into the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the second drop down of the editor for text mess@@ aging , you can define whether the text mess@@ aging book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you select changes , the text mess@@ aging book will not be saved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the buttons on the right , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . additionally , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided in two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the lower part you can edit a text passage . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the tool@@ bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by pulling with the mouse to the new place or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key , you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chosen text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the repository . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sets of the repository memory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tool@@ bar is displayed by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and dra@@ gging , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this menu entry is selected , a narrow strip in the bottom of the main window with notes about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; indicated if not enabled , this status bar is hidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by clicking on the left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you probably don &apos;t have the command for the voice output correct or not fully entered . open Settings to mouth ; set up the General Settings page , and enter the command for voice output on the language synthes@@ izer . ( see Settings dialog for language synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the festival is a University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the speech output , it is assumed that the program is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently it supports English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ et directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tmp / tmp / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all parts of the command must be written in one line , and the option will be turned on as default input . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speech output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language voice that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t talk to output text by the computer . a list of already saved sentences can be saved , which the user can always re@@ charge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer included . on the computer , a voice synthes@@ izer must be installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or start the help center help : / k@@ mouth ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows any application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading text ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; makes ; even if &amp; makes ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech output is carried out via the program of a speech pat@@ cher , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
allows the creation of voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; - Help program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &amp; k@@ de language output service ; , an application without any visible window , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; to configure and setup kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , for reading the texts from a website or parts thereof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a module for the text editor , with which a text file can be read in whole or in part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list on ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ info / k@@ de @-@ Desk .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can use it , you need to install and adjust the program for a speech tool . see also : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speaker is set up , the card card is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card card is displayed General . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different types of voice , synthes@@ izer , voice , gender , volume , and speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es , for the same printer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the card issu@@ er in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card holder will be displayed . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all already established speakers will appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no speaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; kt@@ ts , system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl &apos;s voice to choose from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost you can use . go back to the map General and check if language output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the &amp; k@@ de language sharing system . click on the map Le@@ aders to open this card . here you can set some general options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service and you can create text orders and read the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr ends , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the preview is finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start , ab@@ ort , pause , pause and resume text orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD click on the index tabs General and activate the speech output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed page . then select the text that should be read before and select Tools Text in the main menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Po@@ unds ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text that is supposed to be read first . then select the text that is to be read , and select text in the main menu . then the voice output should begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; k@@ de ; , which noti@@ fies you about events you have specified . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when your nick@@ name occurs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu settings menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the file k@@ mail@@ .@@ x@@ ml which is delivered to &amp; kt@@ ts is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sending mail and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as assuming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops , filters are not required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed before it is sent to the Language Dis@@ pat@@ cher Program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation and to select a suitable language and speaker , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the way the filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the issue of Screen Reader is read , the orders received will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after the output of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . read a long text on a website . &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest are simple text orders . each order you buy from the card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which have no particular ur@@ gency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts , this issue is stopped and terminated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can be further types of filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
string drop@@ outs replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered as words or as regular expressions such as : - ) by text or for re @-@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert from one format to another format . included are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with subscri@@ ber output filters you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program , which has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card card , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . read about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will continue to be modified to the next filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a text assignment , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; Noti@@ fication of &amp; kt@@ ts is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page . the processing is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows the list of standard filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not enabled and is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the corresponding substitute text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ bet . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a language registered , the filter will only apply if the speaker speaks for a text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l key pressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separately by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application ID run programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 shows you can only type it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the string composition filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions correspond with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter when match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of words , the string composition filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this manual you do not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package kl@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XML ; XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path for the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the elec@@ tive elec@@ tive filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , who is set up on the card board or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker will be selected based on the speaker properties , which the program proposes , and the features of the speakers furnished on the card board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if there is a value entered here the filter will be applied if the text contains the regular expression . is on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve a faster processing , try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the text meets the filter conditions specified above , the speaker will be selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to save or load your voice settings , or to delete all settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speaker selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter , if applicable . you must enter at least one condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the language output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , which programmers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which is added to K@@ TT@@ SD by synthes@@ izer , allows you to use this synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d over the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , specify them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have set up the HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ formed filter , but when using the module for festival websites do not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c is installed and found over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only chew@@ ing wel@@ f@@ .@@ What can I do about it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be rec@@ tified by a string of string . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ T@@ TS works with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be started on the command line in an &amp; console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or dated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Debian users can install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ s@@ lt@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded from the source archive for any of the currently created tar@@ ball , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ort , check first if the speech synthes@@ izer works properly with your language synthes@@ izer . for this purpose , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; quot ; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed so that the establishment of a speech pat@@ cher is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can reverse , repeat or ab@@ ort rules or paragra@@ phs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is female and whose sex is female , it is automatically selected by the best suitable speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you click on the box to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Cart@@ ei@@ Ticket Spe@@ aker device is displayed . for example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you only have to enter the festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the character encoding for text that will be passed to the festival . in general , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and display them grey , the selected voice will not allow you to adjust these settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory consumption ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to App@@ ly ) . see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr symbol is visible in the system section , but not the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not yet running , it appears in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card holder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the buttons in this row , you can advance or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr becomes a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio card . see also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only text orders are listed and administr@@ ated . issues of screen re@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled or deleted without support for the appropriate audio module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use G@@ rec@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set the speech speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is equal to half and 200@@ .@@ % of the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented the program must be so@@ x installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to apply the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts , click App@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this card , you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the orders received are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning will keep the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth , is an example of an application that speaks for messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts , the audio output in the queue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the incoming message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the issues of screen re@@ a@@ dies there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read any noti@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use these buttons to add or delete events . when you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this event reads the message before , the message is sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use this drop @-@ down box to specify what to do , when an event occurs . you have the following choices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following wild@@ cards : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can enter the properties of the speaker you want here . default select the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the tab speaker as the top entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event is specified for a certain application , the action is executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event All al@@ erts for the application standard ( any other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can specify the noti@@ fications to be sent as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications for a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start an empty list , click Del@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . it also includes trademarks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification and another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML are only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the issue of SS@@ ML . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 / 100 , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit@@ ings filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . this means that only the first set can be synthes@@ ized , or pause or pause orders , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you see the set limit@@ er filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ort , a set limit@@ er filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add any more set limit@@ er filters , but beginners will get away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection . switch on the box selection , select some properties and check how the speaker selection changes . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can then pause or cancel orders on the map map , even if the language synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these reasons , the normal movement limit@@ er filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
set limit limit@@ er filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set limit@@ er filter retains the pun@@ ctu@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ V ) , warnings , messages , or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have removed the normal set limit filter by mistake , you can paste it again by loading the contained file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the card selection box , you can over@@ ride the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; using the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words , there are no spokes@@ persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ort ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the originally set characteristics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired language properties , by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , do not enter anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mark this check box , if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always used as a priority property . the only case you may want to specify the attribute is when you know that a particular application text is sent in a different language than that set in the working environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to use all features in the speaker field , which is most likely to follow the following , click on the default Spe@@ aker button and use the speaker that is closest to the following . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crash@@ es when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get trace@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x says that you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , you may need to upgrade or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio output of AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text assignment , a message appears , which states : un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions please visit the AL@@ SA @-@ project website ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed them and can use them in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / Vo@@ whatsoever . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card card for subscri@@ ber setup .
the settings for the voice speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is controlled in SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; by &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are very bold change the .@@ x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML form@@ er@@ filter and put the speech speed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t make it that websites are read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for festival 1.@@ 95 beta the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber throws the GEN@@ DER tags . same applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have added an own label maker filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer set aside or go back . on the index tab , orders are displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what do I do wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not filter pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . use a filter for setting limit@@ er recognition instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t.@@ org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some users experience conflicts with AL@@ SA . if your system is also part of it , you cannot simultaneously play music and start a text . you can find possible solutions for this problem on the AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setup of the voice speed , but is not necessarily necessary . Debian users can install apt @-@ get install so@@ x using the apt @-@ get install command . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , log in as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 , the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following modules for voice synthes@@ izer are created by default . some of them have a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) . ( not @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Debian distribution ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as default , &amp; opt / k@@ de@@ 3 is installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Debian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD k@@ de@@ bur@@ gl@@ yp@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd t@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using &amp; kt@@ ort , check first if your language synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is generally good , and multiple voices and languages are supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must install at least one language . for this , please refer to the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male UK ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / li@@ b / Vo@@ IP / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices you need to set up the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions , so do the festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like for example co@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from slide files . you need additional software to create these slides .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Voice files are not installed , but in the folder / li@@ b / . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; German Fem@@ ale ( I@@ MS festival de@@ 2 &quot; ) ( voice location ) / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; German Fem@@ ale &quot; I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; )
on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just insert the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / .
this method uses special code to print the language via festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; purchase and install first festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file Festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .
load the voice file cz@@ 2 from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; file .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; festival Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ ly voice synthes@@ izer backed by a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple voice synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Linux &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage voice synthes@@ izer that works with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthes@@ izer is currently limited to a few languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; download at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page , and un@@ zip it to the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or after / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o ; here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EP@@ s is a free , qu@@ el@@ ly language synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can only adjust the volume with this synthes@@ izer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the Czech or Slovak language and epo@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the EP@@ s programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the box . enter in an &amp; Con@@ sole ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ly voice synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ort , with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled in one &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best , use a command to write the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be inv@@ oked by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf file was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network features .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed while installing &amp; Linux ; if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files according to the kernel version : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the network settings module is loaded when the option network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and is best . by checking the setting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ quiries , the setting will be set automatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are shown in grey , which means changing is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tabs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button , ... in the dialog device . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the automatic mode takes TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the option manual , the TCP / IP address must be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole ; you can determine if the network administrator is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network devices can be activated or disabled , if required . switching on an switched off network device can be activated by selecting and clicking on the interface .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; network devices can be activated or disabled , depending on your needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defines the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network where the gateway computer is located must be selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the respective IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org requests DNS this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy administration of this list . entries can be added , removed , or changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select one entry and then click the Edit button .... There will be dialog Edit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list Nam@@ ely known calcul@@ ator describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boot , if no DNS servers are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally the list includes well @-@ known hosts some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the IP address of the familiar host , and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ s dialog will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the familiar machine and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has multiple alias names , press the button Add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of an especially known computer from the list , and select Edit ... The dialog to edit your computer is displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will refresh the list of static hosts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the home page of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net that you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given . in the second section , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and changing configuration files are discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this section cannot replace more extensive knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about integrating the PC into a small ( home ) network is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely dissemin@@ ated . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important information is knowing which IP address is assign@@ ing to a network interface . in other networks , am &amp; eg ; the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is filed or if available , the IP address can &apos;t be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a particular reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this section , you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections , there is another content than specified there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file will be re@@ ass@@ or@@ ted by the scripts in Su@@ SE . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application , with which you can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ system program cr@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when starting &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; see a list of already set tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root you will see both for all users of the system and system internal tasks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the task is de@@ activated , program name and parameters are not displayed and the description will be de@@ activated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environment variables appearing here set aside the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks , except power . for a de@@ activated variable , it is de@@ activated as a description . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new task , select the tasks folder first . then go to the Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can also click on the tasks folder with the right mouse button and select C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enter the name of the program to be run . you can either specify a relative or absolute path name . if you want to select the program first , press Select .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task is to be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you choose Mon@@ at@@ day ( s ) as well as week@@ day ( s ) , the program will be executed on 1st and 15th and Sunday , regardless of the day of the week , regardless of which date they fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only become active when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut out a task , first select the task to remove . then go to editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perform a task immediately , select this and then go to Edit Now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to create a new environment variable , first select the variable folder . then go to the Edit menu item New .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , click the right mouse button on the variables folder and New ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enter the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environment variables ; click on the arrow next to the variable name field . these are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to send emails from the back @-@ up program to another , then the normal address &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was stored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to cut a variable , first select the variable to be removed . then go to editing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to copy an environment variable , first select the variable to be copied . then go to Cop@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to activate or de@@ activate an environment variable , select it , and specify the state with the Edit Activ@@ ated menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the variable and select Activ@@ ated . make sure the name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if all tasks and environment variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . to do so , select the Save menu item . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or additions to tasks or variables will become active only then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it appears the default k@@ de ; -@@ dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; cr@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the dialog box . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cr@@ on , for example , vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the time schedules of the users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a PO@@ SIX compliant and UNIX ; for example , with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to learn time and date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first consisted of creating a surface for tar that offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast and selective packaging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a tape can be used , it has to be done by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat ; re@@ boot the tape and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . detects and dat ; the pre @-@ winding on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ cle@@ w , it searches for the matching index on your disk . if this is not found , you will be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything went smoothly , changes the tape for the tape drive to indicate that the tape was included . the content of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before casting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; dat ; indicates a change of the band for the band , that the integration for the band has been solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be e@@ jected without danger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before a string of &amp; dat can be used , it has to be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted prior to use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after entering the band name and capacity , the band continues . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape will be automatically integrated and ready for use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed up this file , or folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files , and / or sub@@ folders are backed up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on the local file tree , and select View ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the backup has been initiated , the Settings dialog opens for backup . in this dialog , you can review the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the record for the disk . it will only check the selected file , or folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click in one of the archives , and select the item ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have confirmed the verification settings , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you can re@@ connect the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive , only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select Rest@@ ore in the Rest@@ ore menu .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog box appears for recovery . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ ls using the band contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways , from the band : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files , and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will automatically be updated accordingly to the working folder currently selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up , such as the folder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the functionality of the buttons , files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; files has not yet been fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu , you can make the following settings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape machine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this setting is active , transm@@ uted &amp; dat ; before the tape is included , the command is loaded to the drive . on some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; dat ; to block the throw from the tape drive . maybe this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the option is enabled , when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat file , the tape is automatically e@@ jected . do not use this option for Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to share the block size for your tape drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a band format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band @-@ ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds ; the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that the band has been format@@ ted since the era .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the content of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system leaves the different protocol files . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stored the different protocol files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables users to quickly access , for example , information about issues that appear on their server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a series of useful functions . these include : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many other functions are also included , and are explained in the further chapters of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a log file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log tries ; first the most important log file of the system - the system protocol - will open to you . the log files usually do not appear with system administrator rights . the protocol files usually do not have permission to read in the directory / var / log .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or string . in the default setting , the list of log lines will be displayed next to the filter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process and enter the name of a process in the protocol file system protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to display only a specific process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , you can switch to new lines in the main window &apos;s context menu to display all new protocol lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ ms@@ log ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; in addition , find in the following directory of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; archive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for the program start control when driving up the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. , because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without having to install a new installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following folders : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail , , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc . system services do not include such stuff as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are made to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should be under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if you don &apos;t want to use r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with serial connection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kernel searches for the program in@@ it in different places , and starts the first one he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab , and you should see a line like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably will see something like the following : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually from the command line :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would pause the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument . if it contains a S , the script will be called with the boot argument . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people want to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level that only runs ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move scripts either from Run@@ level , or change the position within one level by removing it from anywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new realm . to just copy them to a new level , you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sor@@ rows number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can attempt to insert the system service again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; note : currently , there is no way to restore entries that have been put into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move an entry to another round level , move it to cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it in the desired round level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to change the tab number or the name of an entry manually , press the tab key to switch between different fields . use the tab key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pres@@ ets will be removed from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the LI@@ LO prompt , type lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in the single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available ( and also see if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) just quit without a message if their configuration files are not present or configured wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you use a different distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the users and groups of your system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapters adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding tool@@ bar icon or the Save in the File menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have limited space restrictions ( quota ) for users , you can create additional cards if shadow passwords , etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card password management appears , if shadow passwords or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this card only appears if for at least a built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( see the file quota parameter in the file system ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system , with limited space limitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the card card group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , which the user owns , can be found in the Pri@@ m@@ aries section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click on the appropriate addition button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , remove and change the boot password , add time to boot of the standard operating system , remove , modify operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
