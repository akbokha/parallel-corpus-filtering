<seg id="480">"" "" "" "sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to let a picture look sharper. actually it doesn't work a bit. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"" "" "" "refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters to adjust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized images need a correction of sharpness. this is due to the fact that blurred edges should be combined with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more sharpness than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"" "" "" "JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. however, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="487">"" "" "" "in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus. you will find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a bit soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Correcter soft draw and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove slime from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">"" "" "" "the original image and the preview help to edit the image. in addition, the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="491">"" "" "" "there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values produce good results and should first be tested. an increase in the radius or the amount increases the effect." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="492">"" "" "" "the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, images should be best sharper in their final resolution." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="494">"" "" "" "the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore avoid plastic flaws in faces, skies and water surfaces." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp mask was used with Radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocus refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask. refocus usually results in better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular Fitting works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's Fitting has a very long tail. the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's Fitting is influenced in most cases even very strongly from the remote pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">"" "" "" "this is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in good results." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"" "" "" "the filter can accept values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>

<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without having to install a new installation and re-formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "" "" "the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following folders:" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if you don't want to use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with serial connection.</seg>
