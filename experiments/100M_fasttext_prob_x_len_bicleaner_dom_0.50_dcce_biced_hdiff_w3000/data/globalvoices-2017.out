&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my dear to America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he covered the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , who wanted to occupy the murder@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; I was as if that is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had even written a very small , warming love letter about its size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so nicely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 million vote , which he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number reaching a candidate nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who are the Americans , who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was not able to reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people , whom I met during my time in Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program that receives people from around the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump world@@ view did not agree with the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance also contrasts with the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles their lives for the environment , and their husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she still fits to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there were Andrew Bac@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Tr@@ ump opened his way to the nom@@ inees republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception to rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the pres@@ idency of a man , in spite of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it is unfair to call the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; junk voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and points out an inability to understand those who act and think in another way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities cannot be taken into account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B ) . : as much as &quot; respecting the White against all other ethnic groups , &quot; the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash word play , as it called the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background we may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this country chose as its President twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the election of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white America yields this promise and says : to Hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud , no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; sh@@ ook the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; cried , and their voices cried lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and all the people looking like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this breaks my heart , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar Mohammed is currently part of the IC@@ F@@ s Knight International Journ@@ alism Fel@@ lowship and a leader of the Code for Africa in Tanzania , a civil technical and data journ@@ alism initiative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ gic city of C@@ ate@@ ura ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music , living with the waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site only 16 kilometres south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some years now , the La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and an adult that has found a way to overcome poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ dit violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot , who launched a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , writes the local press not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and playing trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , french horn , tim@@ el@@ ke , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
music from tr@@ ash
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located practically at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers started under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez to turn parts of the waste into instruments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ a , cello , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he had never seen before , a violin made from waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a documentary called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra , with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the re @-@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for shared use of content .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a legislative criminal of this kind on its coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were swiftly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that refused to refuse everything , &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior executive of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catching fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia due to pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 from NGO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and meet each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by inten@@ ding existing laws to protect certain habitats and species , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once disabled by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and also by the s@@ nail stamp , with information between individual countries , the actions happen today in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing lic@@ ences , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that were noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships very attentive , if they move on the open sea using satellite data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas , such as such that indicate that a ship is inviting its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license , where they were out and possibly whether they have a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such ships in their har@@ bours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about considerable financial losses for the owner , meaning that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the already mentioned platform was created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose the eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year due to illegal fishermen who are entering East African waters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , causing the region to attract commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their practices include sailing under false flag , fake license papers , sampling of fantasi@@ es , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they purpos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the lack of an organized control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the closed front is working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 examinations of suspected vessels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread counter@@ f@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ vers@@ ed and found refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international prosec@@ utor for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and receive information about illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organized crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , to pin@@ point suspi@@ cious ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal ships who like to hide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO which also addresses F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems with which they can no longer be detected by satellites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland will help build a system that links different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a model program
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s Team of African nations can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch jointly with Google and the Oce@@ ana maritime security organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the position of each ship &apos;s track@@ able ship worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - that makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals , but also deter@@ ring them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ships that had been fishing without license earlier and hardly expected consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H now have a 33 % increase in fisheries turnover since f@@ isher boats buy more licenses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member land Somalia was able to report its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 was a ship sailing under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special collaborative approach to protect the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the Pres@@ idency of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the government &apos;s government rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum in favor of a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans responded to the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by putting themselves on the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately , the reverse order of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them can be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas in the coastal areas of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a located in the central North @-@ North Bun@@ de@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation is continuing to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ an people by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the chance for a fundamental change in the recent presidential election of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately it was blocked by official authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which inflation and power rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated to be 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered to be the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the electoral coalition Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic Unit ) in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together to support the National Assembly voted on the 27th of October as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace - the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; The Rec@@ re@@ ation of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a prot@@ esters crying through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the central , north @-@ located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats , because you could see something else what many national gar@@ den@@ ers do not have ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making a round about the scale of repression per day : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the dictatorship has oppressed the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the call for a mandate , which has now been proved in the eyes of many people in the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your deportation !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others are evaluating these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which from their point of view has done little against the devastating economic crisis and have preferred to hide critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they took us so much , but also the fear ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the mar@@ ches increase more and more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than work or shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an adapted version of an interview given by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interview was translated into English , and is published with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine city of Cordoba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano has now spoken against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were being investigated which were committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 34 years , he kept the secret of family secrets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ dian . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 he was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os Son , a man who over the years realized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his story shows which great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a path of redemption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I went to the sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my father about him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and urged me to identify my friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just notice that they will not guide you one day , and I will have to save you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , the Military People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me , I would become a secret agent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so , my father had educated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the base of the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &apos; there the prisoners are tortured , &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father took me four times to La Per@@ la , all in 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first and last time , he let me wait at the entrance in the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he took me the second time , he told me to get off . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were placed and kept me with a guard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , he pointed to an open space and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the prisoners are tortured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went in and saw a couch , tortured by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she looked like a tor@@ rent , and metal @-@ feathers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I found out that it fast@@ ened to the end of a cable . the other end was fast@@ ened to the body of the person who was lying there right there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they rarely grab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured him up with water and pursued him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling , like a dirty di@@ aper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognized the smell immediately , and I realized that the smell of a body is in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that one person can do so much suffering from another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were wearing eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he spoke to Ch@@ ub@@ i Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , I saw a series of matt@@ resses where naked men lay down with the face down - all were tied to hands and feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the entrance , people fell silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why have you brought me up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were cast into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know this , because my father told me about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero , there , killed a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( according to reports by survivors of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina sentenced to death ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the way you came here , is also the way on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look on the map , you see that they took about this path and were then tortured for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the de@@ human@@ ization process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism , for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father brought all kinds of stolen things , home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then at the age , I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when I was in the military later , I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one has fought against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie , and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal , and I said , And you , who h@@ ates cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , we don &apos;t need anyone else ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , my father was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I said in the trial , I showed a photo of the back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roller @-@ collar pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me a burden on what they wanted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , I was there to testify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ the enforced disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ rent act &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one develops and real@@ ises , that it is wrong to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , so you executed people during the dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why kid@@ ding children ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could have put them in jail , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did these people not have families , to whom one could hand over their mortal remains ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
enforced dis@@ appearances are the last vile act one can do to a man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , of course , anything stays forever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to clarify , I have nothing against the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I even went to the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thought of showing my father , arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of all the atro@@ cities , I had to experience him for his sake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you committed terrible crimes , and you were forced to join me as a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he replied only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , I saw the first advertisement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . finally , I have said against my own father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years of hearing more than 5@@ 81 witnesses , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended between March 1975 and December 1978 , committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , sentenced to life imprisonment and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ emp@@ state terrorism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civil servants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped and brought to La Per@@ la , together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for years in justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research was 39 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his license , last month witnessed a very mis@@ bl@@ ending translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a sign , the Japanese word was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elderly car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly - maybe even with bad back @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area from September 1st to 20th , and in the building itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine which has been widely shared in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in the Kyoto Protocol , wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the descrip@@ tive English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , if even gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blo@@ gger reported , as follows , about the ap@@ ology : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely feel that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by insufficient correction ( the translation ) in our turn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News was a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the share of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a 10 % share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the number of accidents suffered altogether , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ named re@@ porter in the article published on Yahoo brought comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently cher@@ ish against older mot@@ orists : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article on Yahoo for the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible car &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So flaw@@ less is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .

the reasons for the widespread distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the original language - should be native speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate the French into French - not from French to English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Flickr user Karl Baron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Japanese companies do not employ any staff with English as their native language , which transl@@ ates into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , will become a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; machine translation is also widespread , often with fun results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sentences and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases , which are created by machine translation , show that this technique will not replace a human translator for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , from large corporations or government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a rep@@ utable source for its translations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , other users wrote that the internet sites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also contributed photos of the Car@@ ac@@ as protests , which were organised by opposition groups that oppose the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court resolved the parliament and transferred the parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that the Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet pages are closed again .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission fores@@ aw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ ah@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) and a research group for digital rights in Venezuela have shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to requests of certain domains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds to errors or den@@ ies the request when calling such a website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we confirm a DNA lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ol@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried out the protest at Car@@ ac@@ as live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fl@@ ores was beaten , while he was in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went to broadcast again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ an access to multi @-@ media coverage more and more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain a training &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ adi@@ ta , a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children , collecting witness testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ tics who have been victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo of Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . , with kind permission of the structural design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report of the structural design , published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before her graduation from university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more mature family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for many days of house@@ work , which can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society , and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after finishing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she spoke with Cri@@ mean tas - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ mp@@ ed the Cri@@ mean tas is generally not silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family , which their daughter in the belief that they complete their training , can improve their position in society and can &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the family that takes the girl with herself and justi@@ fies his exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that she would not receive any training or maybe even star@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn from it only a few years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , they never know about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2016 the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was a face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of intense pun@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the household of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , she worked as a civil servant at the Ein@@ wohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mar@@ ín lives with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with just 3,000 people 250 kilometers east of the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra opened a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered le@@ thal injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the media reported about the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organisations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the ma@@ agu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the death of the girl . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations , demanding that there could be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ently violate the rights of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the neighbours of the couple , and nearly 60 civil society organisations , demanded an immediate investigation of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the case comes to court , Carolina Mar@@ ín &apos;s case could be pointing the way - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is coming to court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Every@@ day of a Cri@@ tic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register and her father lost his work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their brothers had to work all the way , and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all went on to school , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only T@@ ina was sent as a cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital of As@@ unci@@ ón .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , she had to share the time so that she was still time to learn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , for example , cleaned the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time for learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also this time was limited , because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the house library than food out of the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some evenings , the owner forced Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand next to him and read leading articles from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he considered them intelligent , but did not meet her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would once again speak to Guar@@ an@@ í at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Lord feared that she would lose the education she had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was perfectly clear that she had paid for everything she received from them with her hard work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about is mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans exposed to Cri@@ k@@ tas when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to visit me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my youth , at the time when friend@@ ships develop , I was particularly aware that I was not a group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group explaining job advertisements for cleaning staff and children in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administrative coordinator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to learn .
please log in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start from Monday , if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven year girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the author of the advertisement turned once again : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you very much , I write again when something is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the business was finished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pro@@ lo@@ gue , to the Cri@@ mes Report , ¿ How sta cu@@ án@@ do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Cri@@ mean tas , as long as ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former cri@@ m@@ del@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of our history , we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system during the Spanish conquest , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani ) and the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the display of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill signs Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , altered by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
published by Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs have recently agreed to draft law on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations concerning use and use of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established to give citizens a permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and ID numbers to use social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it fails to do so , this could result in a sentence of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video content and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear how the law will be enforced once it is accepted , as the draft has no indication that the Egyptian authorities are not able to register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary deputy and promot@@ er of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users from the telecommunications ministry a username and password &quot; to come through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall around Facebook . because of it , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it has not yet been known that such plans exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Scienti@@ st ( in German &quot; Leadership Research Consul@@ tant &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights ) , &quot; Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I doubt heavily on the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt , concerning things that have to do with technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to apply for citizens who apply for approval or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is technically not realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the legislature and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military mode of thought in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensured that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the Tam@@ er El Sha@@ haw@@ y filed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence for those found guilty was found guilty of threatening public order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the northeast of Iraq work the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows up in the video , &quot; the Persian Leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and in educational programs of Nature Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to creating protection zones for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , produced this video for En@@ sia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his works have been published in numerous international publications , including the TI@@ ME , Sunday Times Magazine , FT Magazine , Washington Post and The New York Times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meyer has filmed films for National Ge@@ ographic , P@@ BS , CN@@ N and HB@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2009 to 2014 , Meyer lived in Nor@@ di@@ ra@@ k , where he founded the first Iraqi photo agency with met@@ ro@@ graphy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to ev@@ acu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to that , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture experienced a nuclear accident . that is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the local point of view , the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the detailed report of the newspaper covers both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority , as well as survey results of those concerned themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er reported that by December 2015 , 77 percent of the planned spare houses were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recorded the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ w@@ ate completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is the final light with 70 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , six years after the catastrophe , there are still six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated of authorities &apos; shel@@ ters ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in accommodation establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 40 percent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation that came after the disaster was moved into final homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three concerned pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six years later , the industrial re@@ building in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , widespread in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear disaster , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of five 400 hectares of destroyed plant@@ land by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear wast@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of tourist arri@@ vals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate is up to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er explains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey , in order to learn more about ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed find that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspap@@ er has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was also witnessed to the worst , disaster @-@ induced , nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of 2016 slightly more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the 2017 stand , 40@@ 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are still living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are more than 50 years old , because the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people meet people from other countries who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a while , however , one often sees that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ ini explains how the love for music has strengthened the lack of common language skills during a journey in the rural China ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experience that he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday a police officer had killed him during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a strike against the head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , studying social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors operated on this Saturday , and now transferred it to an artificial comm@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz , Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , who spread quickly in Brazil during a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pictures , the face of the police officer could also be seen who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the complete suppression would be justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a video @-@ channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz , Lu@@ z , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and hur@@ rying to him several san@@ it@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the clip shown below , one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated $ 2,@@ 700 to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

police attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where the brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officers used protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber floors and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again , the Brazilian media have shifted street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protag@@ onist : a window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ ating their titles , illustr@@ ating their titles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a story story with a brand @-@ set bus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disk than the protests of thousands of people , who serve to defend a special cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must also be recognised , if you are strictly opposed to any kind of material damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; is absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are suppressed by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on the confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dis@@ crimin@@ alization of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the village of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ anti@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there is no significant sugar harvest on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is two years ago , when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the replacement of the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost after and after its installations until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation , because they were preserved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene re@@ members exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the production produced in 1910 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old railway platform of the church , saw better times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural Adap@@ ters &quot; issued by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repe@@ ating is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost all respon@@ dents said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first year of Genesis , the first letters began to come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was official written documents , which were only differentiated with respect to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all were signed by Ul@@ tras@@ ound Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from then on , the responsibility was over@@ cast and the letters came more and more frequent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane plants that was still in operation . &quot; he ass@@ ures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory , in which construction he helped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with every part he removed , he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 years of work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most developed Industrial Area in Cuba and the most important work lat@@ ch was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to the work stations and services generated in the congregations in which they were located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present people saw that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation , everything would go well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted highly by grinding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to rep@@ licate , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , they also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a promising perspective , many young people left the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve to supply the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene joined the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ nine months bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , but he does not tolerate the lies that he told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have been tor@@ turing him for ten years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ene deals 65 years into retirement , not because it lacks strength , but because he is em@@ bit@@ tered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Nations Kids use hip @-@ hop to express themselves , to preserve their own culture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people of the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important for them . they do it by hip hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , workshops and youth centers have been organizing workshops for youth groups to teach Song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original workshops were conducted by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is increasing in such a way that the young participants find topics such as cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance , or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in British Columbia &apos;s Canadian Province and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the field of the tribe of the Kit@@ h@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia tells the story of Highway 16 also called &quot; Highway of tears &quot; a road section in western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most cases , the cases were not solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motive of a video game to convey , how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of globalisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always command the languages of the First Nations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the youngsters involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a crop in the dialect Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , I feel like nobody ever is interested in me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I try to go on my days on earth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the day when you will take our cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as a youth , we have lost our way in life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that we will rise up one day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they can grow and move forward with our youth as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , they can do what the Creator determined to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the comment section , readers and supporters of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also make a contribution and add the crop in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Standard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical Japanese restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plastic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of any dish that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can see these plastic dishes , then decide if they enter the restaurant or go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a whole industry dedicated to the manufacture of these plastic dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small companies that make the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders document@@ ated in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so ordinary that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend transforms them into conspic@@ uous cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now in special sale : new cell@@ phone belts decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ators magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food production is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular seafood dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this part , too , we made for the exhibition in Tokyo Station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is only the beginning , from an increasing approach to the comic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some mobile phones and mobile designers allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , ic@@ ura and laughing , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there &apos;s someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I decorate my mobile phone with laughing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings , and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other bizarre plastic dishes can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the exposure of the restaurant industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ fortun@@ es and killed regularly occur only in statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reports about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , forced the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind each bone , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories innumerable parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project in this way :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers , and entire communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as much as milk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ ri@@ que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how afraid of life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches for his son every weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked to go and to search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t get paid out because they require a death certificate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports by journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central mex@@ ico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for criminals or from specialists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot be in@@ different , or consider this as normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it continues to write :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is , as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see our weakness , when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighbouring village are justified , that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ugly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they try to persu@@ ade that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. of Mexico City wrote the post &quot; Four Mon@@ thly black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family was lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; in this it describes how armed criminals had destroyed money from their business until they had torn apart not only the business but also their family torn apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you think of everything you have lost , and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pain will never pass away , the trauma will remain , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we only contact us , if it is absolutely necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she concluded her report with the words :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days whether weeping would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn how to live with the pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez V@@ ega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence drawn . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is not like other boys of his age , their parents worry about them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , br@@ ate potatoes , cooking tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his childhood was past two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , who was shot dead by armed men from a passing car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez were missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Government Security and Government of the United States Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 fat@@ alities per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories , which leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few stories are still living in the face of new head@@ lines . however , this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co announced the data journ@@ alism project of Nar@@ co@@ data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or , or to expose a for@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the year after something sur@@ faced the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to insist on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to photograph trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this incorrect coupling of picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it raises questions about our desire for images to news . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , a tank truck crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of holes , which were difficult to drive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater nearby , which was full of people who watched the football World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses scattered , and stolen bodies were scattered in the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people were scor@@ ned for un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident appear the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are lined up on the ground while people look at them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but here , the story does not end its end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years the same photograph has been revi@@ ved several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically from atro@@ cities , before which they had to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses and shops were burned down , and bodies lay in streets and bushes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count bodies , &quot; said a man of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burnt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo emerged again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a receipt for mass kill@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one step further , personal comments , such as this example wrong@@ ly fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with the deadly persecution of Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar , the picture from S@@ ange appeared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a lightning storm , published by the United Nations described those who could flee blows , rape and some dead , some by burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , who gathered these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed Burma &apos;s Th@@ ein Being , monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , it had used the image from the DR Congo to depic@@ t this information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be called here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other news agencies , who called AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed a being to this statement , but had not brought the image from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse search , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an inver@@ ted search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come from a mixture of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have forwarded false reports , some have tried others to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the countries listed below ( which were also linked together in some cases ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here are some cases , which can now be completely opened ( on the map in orange ) : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the orange states display pages or servers , and the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports are still available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also show counter@@ fei@@ ting examples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government issued a right to judge what it was intended as &quot; intentionally resour@@ ceful news and photographs that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in respect of Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this judgment , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that are used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often pre@@ valent by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ um@@ ination Management &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post , who directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who are killing Christians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Being 2012 admitted that monks and politicians were involved in killing Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this release the picture is still included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article from 2014 about students murdered by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am news page , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings but it claims that it is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the picture was later put into circulation in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the El Pa@@ is newspaper tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dunk@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image of the DR Congo came up with this T@@ witter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States of America 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as a receipt for the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and Charlie Heb@@ do &apos;s attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be ho@@ ax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ ese Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other confirmed cases of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on other accounts , generators and pages in the following countries ( on the M@@ appe in Grey ) , Tin@@ Eye points also but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the web craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) , which pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence related to Muslims , Muslims , Muslims , Muslims , Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued , compared to a European or French life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and does it dimin@@ ish the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the distribution of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here , for example ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media interact with others ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used in context or in a totally ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , any examination of false acc@@ esses should also take into account how international they can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all to translate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but all of them resist , stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly each attempt of a simple translation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a word or phrase does not suff@@ ice , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of these lists handle Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist chose &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird to focus on small languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the tax @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Pain@@ ting about your parents in recognition of how to deal with you in your younger years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ mah language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words about :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are greatly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite no@@ uns here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , I have managed to add the area of Japan to my portfolio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just published a video interview with the photographer Lee Chap@@ man from Tokyo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Chap@@ mans &apos;s blog and portfolio , his photographs are to be seen on his Tokyo Times Inst@@ agra@@ m and Twitter accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster in the decade , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , the island state of Sri Lanka is facing the worst flood and land@@ mine disaster in this decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by the mon@@ soon , which is normally used at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have stepped over the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a response from Sri Lanka to Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and mud pools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were transported to 30@@ 4 safe places of stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rain@@ falls left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health and hygiene levels of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected , and still in@@ accessible areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of disaster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gu@@ e@@ fi@@ eber crisis , warns the Children , after further rain@@ falls are already on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today morning the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus stood in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da at G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five are made to transport emergency supplies for the inhabitants of their flooded villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have been helpful to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if any search and rescue teams require dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we are in the area around Kel@@ en@@ ya and Him@@ out@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the disaster center is informed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year after the catastrophe of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need bring security and provide aid measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , although Sri Lanka &apos;s population is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children . she is my rock in the fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute , we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we pick up rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ scar@@ f high , bound from an American flag , others chant slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they de@@ composed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow , we are all plu@@ gged into the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drawer is constructed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims , who do not fit in there , become Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dis@@ advant@@ aged to become Muslim
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , I don &apos;t stand alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is even done by the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which pictures come to mind , when you think of him ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love ?
peace ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Jal@@ al@@ u@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i as old as I am now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this del@@ eting constitutes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this enti@@ cing image language is determined by the dark man , which you should fear and the exotic woman you should save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1970s , the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid sum@@ mon@@ ed the story behind these pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these images , however , continue to rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news media and Hollywood persi@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , defective fo@@ ols dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that nine Muslim women have led their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even elect their first female presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative fails to acknowledge that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ scar@@ f in public buildings , Muslim women are forced to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were brought here with slave ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories based on facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also create nar@@ rations , which help us to understand the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims make up the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a third of the total Muslim population is African @-@ like , American . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , coming from 77 countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother laid her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , when Khan was re@@ thinking the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were the un@@ ans@@ wer@@ able Muslims and Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but am I now the un@@ cl@@ utter@@ ed Muslim , American and American ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect of P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I joke , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to combat widespread fal@@ seh@@ oods over Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machinery with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information that our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a stranger who breaks the scar@@ f of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

I would like to explain that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was born into my imagination only when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : belief , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when it could look through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would see the ritual of evening with my daughter , when I saw her in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arabic verses to the protection which seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one that can be seen and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to me is the picture of my mat@@ ernal grandmother with her sisters , as they gain a contest of art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their completed and un@@ finished paintings , a book of one hundred and fourteen chapters , which it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslims means speaking the prayers they told me , when I have a bad day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslims is how they taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a people that has been colon@@ ised by an &quot; Empire &quot; by an &quot; Empire , &quot; it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept for his family in India ruled by K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he could not close in half a century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , like my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being Muslims means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all been colon@@ ised to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped above a century , above a Muslim country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the Grand@@ father of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ jection of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mosque in England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion , go deep into our unforgettable family trees , our un@@ seen history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent from the Antar@@ ctic , to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the w@@ reck@@ age of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is ha@@ unted by the US and the susp@@ ects of a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , a African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali , was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the warmth that I feel , when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be an American woman , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslims and a journalist , den@@ ies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; being a mother means to care for my child and to er@@ ect all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in the Muslim Regi@@ str@@ atures , which began with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it exists in the immigration officer , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from just the countries , which bom@@ bard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly @-@ list , &quot; which seeks mainly Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars we are leading , and the bombs that we throw at Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University demonstrated a scientifically correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversation we have to lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous prints we are hiding in our news au@@ ctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our often overlooked identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square about black , American Muslim authors , the Pak@@ ist@@ ani , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time , in which we are located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one reason for the fact that the conspiracy the@@ or@@ cists , who existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter now , but who made me a inevitable Muslim today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things I left here , like a bread@@ cr@@ umb mark in my speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right now , on the other side of the Bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these are not concepts , with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why am I telling this at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where there was Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people by the work of the &quot; others &quot; were presented in public imagination four decades ago , scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to consider ourselves uncomfortable issues after the role of this , consciously and unconscious in the rain during Women &apos;s March because we have no president who feeds on chocolate cake as he already fed broken countries and &quot; to other &quot; man @-@ made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
narrative art initiative wants to preserve an urban diversity of languages
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; story@@ telling , by Flickr user Daniel@@ e Ros@@ si , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now , despite a language barrier ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices reported a different initiative by Steven Bird , the unbe@@ atable blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land , where T@@ LS has already conducted events , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; listening is often connected with it , &quot; use these events instead &quot; listening to appreci@@ ating , feeling , making . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their dedication and presentation lead to the fact that the audience is listening to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions , as the language is no longer a barrier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following video shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the Daf@@ ing language . during this round , the story@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the be@@ ak of the Rab@@ bit and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his fork , John Ny@@ am@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling guides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Puerto Rico claims to re @-@ establish public debt from the US
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 April 2017 , several religious and bourgeois organisations participated in a mass demonstration with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico . the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ander Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interests in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt , which is not theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find a decrease in profitability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the island , not the sovereign territory in the United States , suffers from a severe financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires extensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , the measures imposed on the outside will be threatened by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration wore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Guard for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture , which is organised in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # free@@ ze@@ el campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of book S@@ prints , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ qu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Research ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the book , published last year and is available roy@@ alty free , contains a series of papers dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge , and what are the real costs associated with . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the moti@@ ons for free knowledge have done page to look beyond the mist that surrounds our news feeds and to make sense of our different experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers who have been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name was painted in the A@@ dra prison directory , where he sat on 3rd October 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling on his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this process , what have we given up from temporary extreme convi@@ ctions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2015 Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his residence and condition remain unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ tia &apos;s cultural prototype was more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bo@@ dying this architecture which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be in@@ valuable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not complete this project until now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am overwhelmed when I call his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el brought me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write , and speak English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el opened my door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ sab@@ uch that she wrote in 2012 until 2015 when he was in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him , and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .

here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
it happens during each visit ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that any of the hazards doesn &apos;t matter to me
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I forget the prison of prison
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will enter every detail of your voice , and words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which I carry with passion with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I will leave another part of my soul with you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to bring back all those moments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to we@@ ep for your absence , and to smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I witness myself , that I will return soon ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year passed , my soul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in your cage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are still In the cage of monsters , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who were arrested or caught under violence by the regime , were tortured or even executed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique : because of corruption , condemned to release after release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of its sentence in which the corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the money came from public funds of Mozambique &apos;s airports , whose advice was to appoint Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good conduct and immediately demanded his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 , then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not carry out any disciplinary procedure after his arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , many residents don &apos;t mean the action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centr@@ o de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we are aware of is that even the firm should have led a disciplinary procedure against the contrary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the firm remained silent though and did not cause any adequate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contradictory &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ fut@@ able !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not morality any moral : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him , I can &apos;t believe that someone has been rewarded in such a way that has massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks moral to return to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself only by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and ultimately sentenced to a long prison term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only as a first independent president , but also as a sharp , ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous verbal representations was when he for@@ c@@ efully confirmed that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ a also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he sat down for 10 years and escaped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and today the company , with which he de@@ vis@@ es mon@@ ies , res@@ ides again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ pa@@ is - Cha@@ ins of the In@@ cub@@ icle at the same time ( @ az@@ once _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network picked up their posts from the network because they contained the word &quot; Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is still being discussed about the origins of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements has given the word an extremely exp@@ elling con@@ notation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful contents on its platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically evo@@ ke hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word , or expressed doubt for their use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , there are several bur@@ ge@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spi@@ der ) &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ itted A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , a mail from one of my friends was extingu@@ ished because it contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty manner whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a p@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it del@@ etes all posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the next words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( ageing legs ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , spreading hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all the hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have demonstrated that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game and the users of social networks are simply beginning to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word in order to express their views .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has removed a number of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed who has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asked for advice : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that gave them a big boost , that would be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook Automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech , but still removed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook is removing the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat violence in the communities in Myanmar especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where cl@@ ashes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his failure , Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control hat@@ eful hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context than on code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanim@@ ously a law that forbi@@ ds this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this change of marriage , some members held out Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere with age , as the age does not determine maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who had been married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 young boys were married to 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , trying to abol@@ ish laws on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader Z. B. had no qual@@ ms about saying the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sort of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree with the draft bill at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who ab@@ stained - so that a simple majority would make it a law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted again on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bill against children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one voted against it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it was decided in the Senate , the draft may now become the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of the social media users were thrilled , because the laws of to@@ dd@@ lers were finally am@@ ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who was a minist@@ erial commission in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which ham@@ pered the core of the matter , but know what ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Abel was the opinion , it took a long time to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the amendment of the Law Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 of them were present in the vote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties agreed to have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children &apos;s marriage is not permitted by law any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ care label .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take court action , should the law be passed and he seems to release his promise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was perfectly legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the issue differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell proposed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather than speaking of the problem that we , instead of speaking of the problem , would like to talk about the state in our bedrooms , that they might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in front of them , would you be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , that this is not a problem ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally or continue to be the norm , even though there are laws they fail to fail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

it &apos;s # Sav@@ ed
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday morning , the Office of the Prosecutor shared the local news agency Y@@ ar@@ news that they were h@@ acked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented in the USA on January 18 , 2012 , contrasting with the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia on crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day , it becomes more clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are fighting against the lock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although many tech sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use forming tools for blocked websites ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Turkey has been blocking Article from Wikipedia , such as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after China , Turkey is the most well @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several M@@ irr@@ or@@ P@@ ages ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer computer connections ) that does not rely on the system of domain names and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of legal prohibition , the content is call@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set up everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ vi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was independent of the Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ homepage from Wikipedia and also Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror that everyone can use to host similar m@@ irr@@ ors when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him , they were blur@@ ry with badly positioned motifs and washed colors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this motiv@@ ates him to carry a camera himself , trying to gra@@ ze the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , he was a child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animals onto the international stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that attract attention to Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he described on Facebook , how it helps him in his work : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just rested at home , when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the river Rap@@ ti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately I ran off with my camera , and was there in a few minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ ad pictures ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he should know it , for he stood before God face to face : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tiger can &apos;t be bother@@ ed by the mind of the sheep , not sleeping ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; late in the evening , the light is too weak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately stops , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for bats &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and live six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below , you can see some of these photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organisation from India . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they should respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences they should neglect the norm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by an Indian state in O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and the community after she had appealed to a married family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is widespread among men . however , they have far fewer supplements to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and thus became the main theme of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ mets who is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and direc@@ ts this club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she reports about how this club created a safe place for these women , and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round was of women , who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands at the name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem , with which women can easily identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom , which they all uph@@ old and never questioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband , and wishes him a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman who does not consider this is considered to be dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without morality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this , up to this round of discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time , after the video ended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him now by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the lap , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the video projection , the women tried to take the discussion with an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman was so shy , that during the whole exercise she ch@@ ased only in front of herself , and another decided to release all the gest@@ ed fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next few days , Roh@@ ini obtained a variety of reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a husband of a participant was less understanding , and the situation was in force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why must women show that they are married ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told my husband that I would wear the zinc @-@ red dot , if he did it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he laugh@@ ed , and I stopped wearing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about what could be heard , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last months they celebrated their birth@@ days with cakes , for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so honest about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected with clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since their marriage , some women in the group have only carried sar@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for most of them that &apos;s okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ one Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their choice of clothing , mor@@ als associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas into a discussion round so that the women could wear them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will manage it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion club has changed a little , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , we have only done small steps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives , such as the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how Roh@@ ini declares :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m too , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this club gives everyone of us the confidence , that something will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when each woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the correspon@@ dents of the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community come from selected groups in India , making videos about stories that are not reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these stories are &quot; news of those who experience it themselves , &quot; and provide a hyper@@ local context to report on global human rights and development demands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration .
the Beat@@ les during their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official YouTube channel of the Beat@@ les .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 29th June this year the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , with many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Beat@@ les &apos; visit to Japan in 1966 is considered a revers@@ al of the Japanese culture of the post@@ war period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for just five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people here have become quite clear , that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith , when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cult band &apos;s music is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good morning ! , Today the Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration is in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les Day commem@@ oration day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is said to be , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places connected with the band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia war@@ med the population , that gl@@ are @-@ headed men could be attacked in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the victims was be@@ headed , and some of the organs had been removed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two men were arrested and subsequently , they were admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a man of glass can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokesman for Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia ruled the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time , that successive attacks on gl@@ utt@@ headed men were registered in Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this led to the UN 2016 , in the South African country , conducted a mission to investigate this practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ inations took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the persecution and murder of independent individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rho@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the police of the Republic of Mozambique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , three men have been murdered in this part of the country with hair loss problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Moz@@ illa Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) plays a key role in expanding the public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community , taking part in our Arab B@@ logger meeting in 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 she reported to the wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , who had been contacted by people who were spending themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a was executed by Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s creativity is a pioneer of Open Web Movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organizations that have set up for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countless of those arrested by the regime or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in custody came to death , thus the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the framework of a partnership agreement , the following version will be published via Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fall of the Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community , after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized in the final stage for liver cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion . &quot; after he participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , China continues to release calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the harsh treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman , however , refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to facilitate the treatment of Li@@ u abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Norway and Norway
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relationship between China and Norway was st@@ alled after the Nobel Peace Prize was given to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to his detention , he was unable to accept his price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European Union
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to free Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for Li@@ us to release Li@@ u as she announced in an explanation on 30 June : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans to have the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it may help him with his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US embassy asked a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and have ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ ley told China to offer the following to the couple : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also launched a resolution in the Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German government spokesman Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hope that Li@@ u receives &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex could over@@ shadow Li@@ u &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ u Law@@ yer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um goes on telling :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to protect its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom of expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an explanation on 29 June , France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments he needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information that France would eventually take in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on June 27 , and to show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ nu , from the governing Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on 28 June at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn has contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally I felt very moving and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 signed for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ sta@@ sis , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the blo@@ g@@ osphere , this remark triggered a debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the State of New York , the Minister announced that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore with other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be considered a city .
... nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is , most people commit a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of a flight ahead of the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal states &apos; , in view of this , it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as one reaches the main point of the topic , the good old ly@@ re is again emerging from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , because it is better suited to their power . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end of the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , the answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was able to answer corresponding questions , with non @-@ responses of rational nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rachel Z@@ eng is asking Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ el to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personally , I think it is a bit difficult to swallow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be very grateful if our remarkable K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ q would take the trouble to clear this point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as An@@ on publishes his comment on the blog , he points out about the critics that one should start reading the entire address of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities watched a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore is not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , which is the leader of an approaching generation , which makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said in Singapore ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what awaits me - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes he is right and who is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review outlines the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam committed a mistake , or was it a frau@@ dul@@ ent advocate ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , the statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ amal@@ gam are of serious importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , defend them only their city , but not their country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are we the citizens of a country , or the inhabitants of a city ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade for Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore dates and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , we should speak about the defence of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or home country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on which situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed pol@@ itely to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my clarification usually follows the standard answer : Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible to their back@@ pack , when they are travelling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all love Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Americans , on the other hand , ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , there are no weapons ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone seems to think , Canada is so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , we often say &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country across ethnic groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not as these guys , south of the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have many American friends whom I admired very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t mind if you could change me , for example , with Johnny from Dallas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first : being called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ici@@ ous - like the good , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inno@@ cu@@ ous , is to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to make no attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a prime minister of Canadi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin hu@@ gged the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada virtually sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pop band in Thailand has released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ dies , which took power in 2014 and despite its promises to restore the civilian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ des Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells the prescri@@ p@@ tions him his girlfriend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although not expressly politically , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 le@@ kes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politicians , particularly how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take a look at these videos of the videos , which relate to some of the political themes that Thailand has persist@@ ently followed in the past three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution granting absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; recruitment &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , monitored online content and persons who were accused of having been slan@@ dered by the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thailand uses a strict asylum against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ est &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two days later , it came to a coup d &quot; é@@ tat of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to buy is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video will even show how people will be thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in prison , because they supposedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened by long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the album showed members of the band , who used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; which was already used by Putin opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
life goes on to the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post @-@ war society only picks up very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still very visible in this part of the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ den@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asia Minor , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to sovi@@ et sites in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the largest part of Russians and deport@@ ations live in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ab@@ ch@@ asia , such settlements are also called ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10.000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after barely over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1989 , some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the empty five @-@ stor@@ e@@ yed blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chen@@ uk@@ ov@@ ka , are symboli@@ cal for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buildings are exp@@ ire and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native elderly man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he starts talking , and it is difficult for him to end this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens all served by the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded beauty buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the bor@@ ough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty people live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , is recognized by the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discover me in the hand with the camera , they immediately withdraw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Mother has forbidden us to be photographed , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend , and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ u@@ go@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and growing vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to get over the rounds , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t have to leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter , insi@@ sting that she supports her young grand@@ children instead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could add zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will add zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s talk partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day , she re@@ members the village life before the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital of Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each child , Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child &apos;s money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over time , it lost its anxiety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when our conversation turns to the end , a small boy runs over us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him behind .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , a group of children follows the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these ruins are part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ gi@@ bility in their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .@@ or@@ g. and appears here with friendly permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ak@@ ula , located at the border to Guatemala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is headed by a young Mexican woman , a young woman with a coral pink frame and gold coloured ear@@ ring in a ted@@ dy bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is named Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ak@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no sign to the hotel , yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez tells people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you M@@ um Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have slept outside on cardboard boxes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has recently arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel very comfortable here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard about other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil previously and worked as construction workers at the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells you that your guests often send text messages when they are gone , to greet them or to report on the course of their journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the driving force of her work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ak@@ ula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a polic@@ eman , and has found that the bus tickets to many African migrants are sold too expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mostly Hai@@ tians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explained that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I crossed the border crossing the desert , and we suffered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Tap@@ ak@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , single @-@ handed , has offered him their roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is again full of guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers calm@@ ly consult their phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a proud grandmother , she leav@@ ens numerous photos in her album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen , which she has made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travellers more , boy and old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she s@@ miles sad , while she makes her brief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on July 10 , the cell phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district received a mobile notification calling the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist acts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private we@@ Chat group had been replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine and track the sources and distribution channels of terrorists together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main feature is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used in many ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ inely internet shut@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cens@@ ored news published in China , published in Twitter , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen were in@@ discrimin@@ ately examining whether they had installed the monitoring app . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required the people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are discovered by a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have forced people to use appliances , which are intended for older people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which it produces that the software can lift the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ise the dissem@@ ination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all government departments , authorities and institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible , both inside and outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who gives honour to her name , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one who has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions , which don &apos;t allow metaph@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when the reality re@@ covers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the performers , the characters turn into flesh and blood , and everything cries out for death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all doubts dissolve in smoke and you will become aware of your existence , even though the Earth is trapped on the axis of the evil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but it was not enough for me to learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he proved his power over us , destroying even the simplest concepts that we knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a peaceful protest , five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of night with &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the districts sought after , only my own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down , after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ing through silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt cour@@ age@@ ously enough to get together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we united to a glorious picture that filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at such a moment you are aware that you liber@@ ate the mind from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ ened it all the way up to the Office of Security Service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , my father was already there as I am now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts speaking : &quot; let me hear how you cry out &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar , or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his hat@@ eful eyes were on me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I did then , has nothing to do with courage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped seeing you in your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not regret the word of what I said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father like this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this day , the sten@@ ch of this cursed proposition is up to me in the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a psych@@ ic torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the courtyard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first office , I leave everything I wear with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I enter the room , I conc@@ eive all the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other than that , they probably gave me a bigger cell this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with just one other prisoner , and I must immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ established communication method : hit the fist against the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my c@@ ousin was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ aid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally responded to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him free , if I remain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ oured on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I still listen to them &quot; Alla@@ hu ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at that time the scre@@ ams are heard , every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of corruption , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; reference to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the secret revealed : in order to protect the security against us and to prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they expressed their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky husband ; at least he is so present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start doing so much more important with your life than to protest against this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got used to it , not to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really no longer tell exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication , after a friendly conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and how it happened , it was un@@ important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I did not have done anything to earn this punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on punishment , in all its diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts with a plastic tube , probably from the clo@@ aks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your cry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold your cries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my cry was not enough to him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within one hour three of them changed , while I was still in the series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any fav@@ ours , which is why he came next to an electrically charged rod . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my half @-@ naked body , lying down on the floor , was the perfect conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared , and the pain was back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to go to sleep again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hours passed , which came to me as minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the light fills the room &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to be fear@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and keep you , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , they had always released me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he slides to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what one can rely on , is to discover a cigarette between his fingers , or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he lives in the top floor of his family house which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family was forced to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ ine ye@@ witnesses ( such as Far@@ mer ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their well @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted by borders , and he can feel his own statement with people suffering from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against American foreign policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as the &quot; Palestinian P@@ oultry of the Second Generation &quot; - this is how he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; while he breaks into two cups in water . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Jord@@ anian law , the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the s@@ lack of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan drinking water - in order not to land in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Interior Ministry Jord@@ ani@@ ens has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some members of parliament that support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual fron@@ ts@@ ban@@ ger Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert evening .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free speech in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which poses the tried and tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this statement is unlikely to be simple rhet@@ oric , but in fact an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released traditional gender standards by developing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low @-@ worn , unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who were supposed to trust them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , in Jordan the number of &apos; honorary mur@@ ders &apos; has increased - the in@@ official out@@ going . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a law on the crime of crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be detained in@@ definitely , and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee by the family that nothing will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music also enjoys great popularity and is well known to not shy away from topics , which have long been regarded as t@@ abo@@ o in his country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been in@@ filtr@@ ated to me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b inv@@ okes the question of Palestinian identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ ent , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the list of songs that are political in the core , can be continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this song , one verse is repeated notably : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity , or homosexu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noticed that barely anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Y@@ ord@@ an online program Ro@@ ya , to mention later that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but it was only an edited version , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intoler@@ ance does not speak to homosexu@@ als from Islam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ eva , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in memory today thanks to his homo@@ erotic ti@@ ghtness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ eva , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the 8th century , why can Jordan do it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices will be sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the actual challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;s Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - it is clear that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the region will be approached by music , art and literature by a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kind of cra@@ ck@@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis reporting , which A@@ man belongs to as a student Fel@@ low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in A@@ om@@ ori , Neb@@ uta is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these big , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory is that the ar@@ rests of the West inv@@ aded Japan in the north @-@ east in order to force the indigenous people of the region into the E@@ mis@@ hi region .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we could grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a joint venture in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , I look at the Meg@@ uro @-@ Ga@@ jo@@ en : two fixed cars are just to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and yet another breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a height of 18 metres was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo by F@@ adi El B@@ enn@@ i , by Al Jaz@@ e@@ era English on Flickr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside appearances and body care were so important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ bery and illegal drug trafficking are common@@ place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 2017 , a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of the region is not safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers who can educ@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy who are located in El Cal@@ la@@ o found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive a training in hair@@ d@@ ress@@ ers that enable them to find work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the school year started in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their achievements : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialised school in the municipality and district where we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this education community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do we only write love letters to people , who we know ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is it not even more important , people who feel compelled to meet affection ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
precisely this question left the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace agreement with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Colom@@ bi@@ ans , however , there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gu@@ erri@@ ll@@ as , who have lived in illegal camps for many years and carried their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward gu@@ erri@@ lla warfare , must now assimil@@ ate it into its ranks and support it in setting up a new life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bi@@ ans would close together , and would have to help with the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla warri@@ or , which should then be handed over personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi - which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this stated that we love the people we love , on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more needed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed urgently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ I never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation moved to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the F@@ ARC have set up as they did before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this time they did not receive any orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; said the student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after we had passed the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla warri@@ or who wrote something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered him anyway , and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what do you do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life someone has written something so nice , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hu@@ gged him , and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in hiding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of F@@ ARC therefore declared the history of the organisation , their ideals , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hear these people who haven &apos;t found their hearing , and to realize that people who &apos;ve often seen as monsters and even hate those who have been turned around by their lives and their environment was very painful for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reality , in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it comforts me that all people , even those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many former fighters responded to the letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp command@@ ant in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Colom@@ bi@@ ans were prophes@@ ied that , after dis@@ armament , peace would reign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is not the case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we from the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will bear many difficulties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ ab@@ re@@ ova , and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with hor@@ r@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the threat that hangs above the LG@@ BT@@ Q community , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ ist compla@@ ining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community , has not yet been created overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has won the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that deal with the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ lady , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she grew up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens experienced the sex equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , she moved out of fear for her life to the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ lady who was in trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the rounds throughout W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was watching a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I felt nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you flock ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that it was a young man , not a 30 @-@ year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I lost consciousness , and finally woke up at the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : in which cases were you laid , in which the men or women were ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is my male name on it ; but the doctor knew and put me to the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , I am very grateful to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am grateful for him , that he was respect@@ ful with me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I spent more than one month in hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last February , I received threats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requested to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove that I had not changed my sex in the official TV in Gros@@ ny , and I told my sex that everything was just bad speech and Phot@@ oshop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have said on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some older people said my mother , on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has damaged not only your family , but the whole republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was too much for my mother , and she laid a rope around her neck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark windows and a plate sign with a 95 on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I bought it without registering me , without identification , without anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re security , just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our people know , in which hotel you were stuck . you even know your room number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you , it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oos topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some traditionally , Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still carry in myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as I wish , this psychological barrier I cannot overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we chat with camera , I really bother to look like the person they remember from their past - so on my male form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : last week , I submitted a report in Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I needed updated information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to someone who had settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan was barely able to wait and he did not lock a new wave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , they will now concentrate on family and relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this I mean , they probably invite relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : are , even now , gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says , there wouldn &apos;t be so many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to set themselves up in Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as I know , they are recorded there to be able to present them later as terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were purpos@@ efully immersed in radi@@ cal@@ ising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : is that just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone , who was detained in ar@@ gun for one and a half months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after their beard was grown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was nothing new of them ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why would you not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think I was already known already before 2003 , when I was living there - and I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the ear@@ nest !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately has thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : how is this possible , under the Sh@@ aria law ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were hat@@ ched ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wearing tube jeans and short tops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Security of the Sh@@ aria has never har@@ med me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew why men , young people , met there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often said to children , when they make fun of the sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they just shut their eyes off you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace begin ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov entered the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about women &apos;s conduct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city started to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at once , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : which activity do you go now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month , not much in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ins , meetings , I accompanied them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t spend a cent on it for a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I discovered these people myself , when I sc@@ ap@@ pled influ@@ enza . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am Muslim and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ ot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , nature has nothing to do with religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who wish to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ inian , who have the Russians also which ; on the whole planet , they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from there , so it is uncomfortable for me to hear something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , going to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan , live together with men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , many think about transi@@ ence to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different attitudes towards life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not if I have a partner , or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I &apos;m not sad at all , I just know that I am myself now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local groups warn against an increase of suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate , within the indigenous Arab population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the last months , there has been a strong rise in suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 back the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child , living in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself , firmly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that a few others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ a@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have hang@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family F@@ athers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families due to prosecution from the Iranian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the region , which is a major part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make their living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and in 1925 forced great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the native population receives little from this wealth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Iranian regime is den@@ ying the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arab@@ ians systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has also built a variety of tribes that surround the Persian territories in the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ ks increased to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who had a job , finished the primary school , finished 55 % and finished a university degree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ him@@ i said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of new ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting @-@ up process : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because officials and institutions do not preference Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance from young Arabs and forcing them to make their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are people who had to change their first and last names in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired , because even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated because speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arabic clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement submitted by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who den@@ ote themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminine * inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money despite the same education than men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that cultural and social norms are still ensuring that women come to a glass of glass sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still passing through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all of this , I am aware and well @-@ known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m a black woman .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on black women of women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention in what way we have been ab@@ used physically , spiritually and verb@@ ally , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , all agree that women should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and to sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they do not want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or in addition , black women and women of other ethnic and home countries earn less than white men and women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women are exposed to a higher risk in black spheres and women with an immigration background , suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman who refuses to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in her thinking , focusing on gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging to a white @-@ feminist orientated sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 , &quot; Am I not a woman ? &quot; and I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a human@@ ly and margin@@ alized entity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absorb our customs and customs by promoting their ego@@ centric programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I prefer to release myself completely and completely from femin@@ ism , which has been called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : as we are able to defend ourselves , we can create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women of other cultures , for in this paradigm I exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of my dark skin and my being , I am recognized as a woman as a part of this paradigm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither ski@@ pped nor ignored nor rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of Kur@@ dist@@ an in Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution upon his church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sum@@ mar@@ ises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist based in Er@@ bil , Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus of her work lies on the following , little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co @-@ operative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with whose help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their tough@@ er fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ial . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Whit@@ sun@@ ein@@ ef@@ rie@@ bin ) which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected individuals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her partner who had become violent against her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when another woman reported Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also reported nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few days later , the second woman retired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ever report , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ trin@@ sic atings and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that has nothing under Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation blows and statistics &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centr@@ o de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studio , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the figures available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General fell in 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were more than 5,000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women of women Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who are unable to do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a separate crime , the prosecution authorities cannot reasonably document how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of suicide in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a complic@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo by Jes@@ sie In@@ fr@@ an Pé@@ rez . use with friendly authorization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which under@@ takes nothing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but she still gave it . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she carried out the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never thought I would be a victim of mal@@ treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I read about it , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the mal@@ treatment by Carlos Vera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without names , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she liked it so long from Carlos and did not leave it earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed almost as if they wanted to say , that victims of mal@@ treatment would have at least a certain complic@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner had been ab@@ used her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you , &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in some way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they do what many others do not do , they take the women &apos;s statements seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Victori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without result and even from their relatives , Victori@@ as ads did not receive any support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it led a process against her former partner who developed into an im@@ penet@@ r@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many laws in Paraguay which are very good but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Carmen Ik@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ st ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # non@@ natives ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the law fores@@ ees , fem@@ ini@@ d to explain and to punish Fem@@ ini@@ d as it is the case already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the law text has been changed in some points in order to also be eligible for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are generally prohibited in Paraguay and are pun@@ ishable by up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original bill had envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs which must be borne by the victims of violence , if they just want to report and receive secure accommodation to the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legislature has no adequate financial resources for it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here a re@@ think must take place , so that violence can no longer be seen as something normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as ill treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 10 November 2016 the law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opinions on the changes are diver@@ ging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the section concerning reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; gender violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is regarded as a big set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ ial . the article is part of the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # Whit@@ sun@@ ein@@ ef@@ rie@@ bin ) which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed for the protection of the affected individuals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Oman one year after ban of a newspaper , independent media continues to face attacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ ami . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than a year ago , the authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ ami because of its reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ tan@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other editors of Az@@ ami , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were also arrested and placed in court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had dismissed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , in addition to its role as the only sul@@ tan , the main offices in the country , Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , General Secretary of Finance , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic civil liber@@ ties , public freedom , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists to torture , in@@ timi@@ date and in@@ timi@@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically analyze peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights , including activists , to express their views on public affairs such as corruption in public authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attack on the Az@@ ami newspaper , its closing and imprisonment three of its editors during the last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ ami is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) , until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ ami , published an article titled &quot; High @-@ ranking political parties &quot; in court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put under pressure judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ ami of July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of justice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial board , was loaded from ISS before the Special Department and was arrested by the security forces upon arrival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2016 , ISS was editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper was prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in Mas@@ kat &apos;s trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms , and ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of public prohibition and slan@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2@@ 600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of $ 5,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( $ 13@@ 000 USD ) was fixed and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the end of the Jud@@ gment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a court hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after losing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his prison sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Appe@@ als Court rev@@ oked the order of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ ami . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the decision of the Court to release Az@@ ami , the paper continues to face attacks by the Brazilian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information received an instruction with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ ami &quot; was extended by three months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information received a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ ami &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to permit the publication of the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ ami and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper aren &apos;t the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated in press freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further violations include , for example , closing the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ ate@@ c and exercising pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ ami and the arrest of journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the authorities still are not ready to put an end to the extensive infrin@@ gement of press freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ ami , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4. to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their ri@@ ghtful human rights work without fear of re@@ pris@@ als , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are two reasons for medical research on site , and there are two reasons why there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists themselves helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) , Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious effects on national health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Post@@ do@@ c at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself explored the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understanding of the media about this research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , my work focuses on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : what do you think is the important current scientific topics in your country , and in general in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is no basic research here . we only put solutions , which have been developed elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recipients instead of being a mo@@ ver yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GV : where is the financing and support coming from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : how is the research infrastructure , too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists , in Africa ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GV : can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa compared to western countries , based on your experience ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change food production worldwide
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA , since the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ ish , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many kinds of salads he can get . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use them further for breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , special red or green or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a passionate representative of a millen@@ nia old tradition , Mor@@ ton always has a salad , but he needs longer since his work becomes more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to p@@ addle for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new salad because all the features are already patented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material protected as intellectual property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the USA and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source , Bre@@ eding ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the ISS International Space Station have bred and ate red red@@ dish sal@@ ts in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station , where it is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area , not from the field of plant breeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders may ple@@ dge to freely use the seeds bred by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders are merely allowing others to breed their seeds , and to avoid them immediately - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
the prospects for glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; independent breeders would try to use the latter , not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way this vegetable is bred is threatened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ob@@ lige others to keep their seeds freely available . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant traits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited , shr@@ inks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for other plants , such estimates are not yet available , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that large @-@ grown crops such as wheat can be patented in an even larger style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question of view
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plants are grown so that they have targeted characteristics - from such , by which their taste or colour improves until such , because of which they prosp@@ er in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more needed than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an email , Mon@@ san@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is limited to other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , these instructions help others to get the same result with another method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton sees this : 20 years wait until a patent is running , certainly doesn &apos;t promote innovations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that have been adapted to the changed environment , you would have lost the struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton , however , is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want farmers to facilitate their work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plants form it themselves and as breeders , we have no idea how the plants do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; who breeds a variety also breeds its own values into it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation it is required to produce large @-@ scale her@@ bi@@ cides , is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets ) own patents , most smaller seed companies can survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the independent plant breeders , Frank Mor@@ ton , is looking for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bre@@ eder would be innovative by avoiding plant pat@@ enting : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know my competitors are selling my varieties for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in resources , is working together with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds , and to sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open source license , which is ultimately a form@@ less and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( regulations for breeding are different from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the Member States to implement the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on open source seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for open source seed seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed seed systems for which the official starting signal will be scheduled for next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an association of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , publishes a report that farmers have the opportunity to come to seeds , exchange and improve seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be guaranteed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems is emphas@@ ised - a link between Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has especially taken care of where and how something is grown and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ukrainian Wikipedia has chosen the eleven best photographers in the national part of the Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; international photo competition , where nature monuments and nature reserves are in focus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award ceremony took place on October 7 , 2017 at the Museum of Natural Sciences in Kiev , where the winning photos were presented in an exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ukrainian part of the international competition received 3@@ 56 participants over 15,000 photos with more than 1,@@ 8@@ 60 subjects related to natural heritage in the month of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about one thousand of these pictures are already being used in Wikipedia articles , which are published in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all winners received certificates as a reminder and other prizes , such as souvenirs with the competition logo or coup@@ ons for online shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authors of the 11 photos with the highest j@@ uries as well as competition participants , who photographed most of the objects and collected most points in the total score , were honored with the prizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other awards were awarded by other organizations , who joined the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the employees of the nature park Holo@@ si@@ iv@@ sky@@ i , located in the metrop@@ olitan region Kiev , have selected the three best photos taken in bes@@ et park and submitted to the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition there were also several special categories in the national competition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Un@@ told Discovery &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which documents the destruction of natural habitats , an overview of the topics , in the photos on Wikipedia , best photos and best Kiev photo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Wiki@@ pedi@@ ans from around the world participated in the &quot; Wik@@ i Lo@@ ves Earth &quot; photo competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best photos of natural monuments ( such as nature reserves , landscape protected areas , national parks and picturesque landscape areas ) can be admired in a common gallery on Wik@@ im@@ edi@@ a Com@@ mons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizers and other contribut@@ ors have used the h@@ ash@@ tag # Wiki@@ Lov@@ es@@ Earth to publish photos , and promote the willingness to share a common share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , they have divided over 13@@ 7@@ ,000 photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , the Egyptian authorities lock content on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government imprisoned the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , the Network published an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains - despite this attack and the s@@ coff@@ ing of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should actually defend the law to overcome these goals and to give victims a voice . we insist on fulfilling our task further .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , the independent news page of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights scientists Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dissem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ or apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent almost 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and recorded a video as the police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada said to the lock by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blogs lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a Siege state ; A arrest , a attempted murder , accus@@ ation of national Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other web site for which I worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence if only to a small audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the courageous go the way , until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities closed from 24 May to 0@@ 6th of August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers , through the transformation of inter@@ networks and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the closure of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content , to which Egyptian users could have access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is also ag@@ grav@@ ated by the fact that cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which it can proceed against these actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship , and who will attack it next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the people argue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian army in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day after day newspapers in all Brazil talk with dark news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot dead in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air@@ tw@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization , Global Justice , even called on the United Nations to intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports like these have become common@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for detailed coverage of violence in Rio , &quot; That &apos;s not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the reports about violence in the city are now being published there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper thus explained the motives for their decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery or sexual crimes etc . everything that passes from civil@@ ised standard and what only happens in Rio is our way of calling : that &apos;s not normal !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the only alternative , so as journalists , we do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des said that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a war @-@ break in a country that does not recognise the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same video , a journalist concludes that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the editorial , the paper continues to write : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to conce@@ al atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm you more than it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as an extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education , and self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency in public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; writes them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company Glob@@ o is one of the largest media companies in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning , however , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also ent@@ ails serious consequences for people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is that the residents of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a week ago , the police came up with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sales@@ man died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly by the Assad regime towards loy@@ alist troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ u@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2013 , these areas controlled by rebels have been under siege outside Damascus , causing residents to rely locally produced or sub@@ du@@ ed by tunnels and check@@ points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academ@@ ics educ@@ ate the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they call themselves G@@ hir@@ s Al@@ nah@@ da , and conduct the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the food which is planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the direct of the project , Nab@@ il Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose the cultivation of mushrooms as they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years , announ@@ cing this project and expressed his relief that it is now gaining popularity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to earn money for the initiative , you can use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ s Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to give 125 families to the planting of mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the Constitution , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise funds on Can@@ do until Monday , 4th September 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuel is used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; production of the fung@@ al seeds from the regions , &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they planted a small mushroom place in a tub . when they succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i throughout East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( like paper , tea , coffee , box , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for victims of 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal on 21 October in many districts of Portugal , calling for justice for victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the North of Portugal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions , spread across the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande acquired a similar tragedy , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images alone , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal by 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a Europe ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the In@@ visible Trage@@ dy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire prevention measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people wondered why civil protection was unable to contain the extent of the tragedy , as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of the farmers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open streets , which were surrounded by fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , building permits are questioned in locations with high risk of fire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the roll form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was deb@@ ated by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed construction activity in case the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val runs on the same article of the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the environmental organization of Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this type . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when people were looking for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they took advantage of their own civilian protection data , using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spreading of fires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , and this fat@@ eful weekend in October was so crucial that the site counted more than half a million requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out among the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 year old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she would not see her son any more - maybe even more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the boy was to break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari ; the leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ W@@ ah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara had just been killed by the Taliban and many ha@@ ils suddenly felt un@@ protected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k was again in Pakistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few years , he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar , which were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was characterised by misery and exploitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k returned to Italy in 2002 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago A@@ geh@@ af was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , sleeping in parks , and went to a church who distributed food to needy twice a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true , though , that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high double quot@@ as . it is also true that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are disa@@ strous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organization , Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe , writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially submitted an application for asylum - which may take months after the application of asylum applications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so it was A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , his unt@@ amed li@@ festy@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having made various works in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k was hiding his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this went so well that after a while , he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ geh@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film received the Venice City Award 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including cutting shops , travel agents , hotels and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Afghan restaurants have even been praised by the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s &apos;s goals , however , reach far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and target back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , &quot; A@@ shar@@ k says with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country , and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same possibilities as all the others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development towards the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ geh@@ af has made this trip himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; globally Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ eds report is an international snapshot , which shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill , which fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a governmental authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; users need to register to take advantage of social networks within six months following the successful law decision on the website of the authority , stating their full name and ID number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law , which was promoted by 60 members of parliament , is currently on the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another Member of the Congress held a legislative proposal in which harder pen@@ alties for insul@@ ting the president or a high official would be introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the law proposition , such action would , however , be punished with prison and fin@@ es , such as legal experts from the Tah@@ rir Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the law be passed , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resignation of the elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 prot@@ esters who had been arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison administration failed to bring the accused of prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that there are weapons of weapons , illegal assembly , murder and an attempt to kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous event , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gate un@@ spotted documents
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; owned by the President of the Republic , according to the plan , Ben G@@ har@@ bia contradic@@ ts a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans look like support of the bill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia , under the name of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , refused to provide journalists with the right to protect their resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share messages in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rules , it is also stated that registration will be required with the full real name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks is to be reached . it is unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these rules only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
will we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat decided to register as an &quot; organis@@ er of the dissem@@ ination of information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this designation is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that are responsible for the publication of the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these websites are websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ kan@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the information Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication drew on , the site was closed because it is &quot; an information source working together with groups to initiate a political offensive campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , next to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after this week , the British government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers , which would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install back@@ side programs to de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services with regard to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
