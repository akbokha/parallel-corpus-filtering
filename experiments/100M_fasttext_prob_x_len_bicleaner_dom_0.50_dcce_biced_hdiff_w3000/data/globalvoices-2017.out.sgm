<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="2657">"" "" "" "Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk as the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited, shrinks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2658">"" "" "" "Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2661">"" "" "" "plants are grown so that they have targeted characteristics - from such, by which their taste or colour improves until such, because of which they prosper in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">"" "" "" "opponents of patents on plant properties suggest that the available plant material is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more needed than ever since the changed conditions are much less predictable by climate change." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2663">"" "" "" "in an email, Monsanto acknowledges Carly Scaduto that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "" "" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is limited to other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties encourage innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"" "" "" "often, these instructions help others to get the same result with another method." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2667">"" "" "" "Morton sees this: 20 years wait until a patent is running, certainly doesn't promote innovations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2668">"" "" "" "and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that have been adapted to the changed environment, you would have lost the struggle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2669">"" "" "" "the main argument for Morton, however, is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to facilitate their work.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "that is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "</seg>
