that is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you may know him , because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA was illeg@@ ally owned by Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence service , in which the CIA literally handed over to Iran dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that sounds nuts , read it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , only days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , although they were for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his agreement , have kept his telephone links secretly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel notes with the list of his flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ cker and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is down@@ gra@@ ding too much of its work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 11 September , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional addition , because the government has more and more opportunities to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but just as technology allows the government to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and indeed , they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been written as a crack and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as in any usual contact form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so the government can no longer obtain information secretly , and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to sh@@ ew mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the next environmental officer , who wants to report the alarm for the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our constitutional right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
&#91; the Panama Papers revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; tremendous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and attor@@ neys go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has already lead to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , has tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that sounds like the plot of an agent , or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why should we do this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that concerns all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , disclosure is phenom@@ enal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the whole world media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used by a few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think many people seem very confusing this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always imagine it , like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these containers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it interesting , that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably because there were no more prominent Americans , who came forward in these revelations , this scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans , who hide their fortune in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by the principle of which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens operate , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , in some US states , less information is needed to establish a company than to get a library card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees from bor@@ ou@@ ghs to rip school children , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has allowed che@@ aters to zoom , especially vulnerable depos@@ itors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our investig@@ ator was the African Minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were really shocked by the fact that we made proposals to a lawyer of our investig@@ ator , how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to us . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leader politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to overcome this , we have to change the rules of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to change the rules , to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may sound absurd as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing has ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that things have begun to change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen a push towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic took political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 , Northern Ireland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU records in central registers at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US has left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have t@@ abled a draft bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind sha@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy that get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to stop this sort of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an outlet store . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped , and looked at my clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that , he would go to the cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole matter worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard me say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ä@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wild stranger , sleeping in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ one on the toes to the door , and closed my bedroom door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of art which he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom , he is now a teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the people who were sold as strangers in childhood , actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us take a time jump , two years later ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost flat , my room@@ mate is pulling out and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to turn fear into fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; Air@@ bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they found it super , and we too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am sure , our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ ts tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time , and could pay our rent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
things came rolling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay overnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , they are not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business , allowing foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because as children , we all have learned that foreigners are dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have a problem , you are contempl@@ ating the things you can do . we were able to design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to give you a taste , which degree of confidence we asp@@ ire to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thumb up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I would like you to unlock your mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
give your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet flight of panic that you now feel -- -- is just what hosts will feel when they open the door first .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it feel to hold the locked cellular phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , most guests feel that they stay somewhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , our company can exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like that , who is Al G@@ ores &apos;s mobile now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could you please , on Twitter , that he is candidates for the office of the President ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can now return the mobile phones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build , and I would like to tell you about some discoveries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he told us where he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that say : &quot; he can really capture very well @-@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , a well thought out feedback system significantly boo@@ sts trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , we made some things wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest gave their testim@@ oni@@ als before we ordered them online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surprisingly , we trust the people most , which are most similar to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case , by assessments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a good reputation ste@@ als common ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , we learned that trust depends on how much you fare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; you get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I make holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can I create it with design , to make this degree of openness ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects to write something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with what we did not reck@@ on , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , you see how many people claim our offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can recognize three things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thir@@ dly , a need not met before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , business is going very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were guests who have not allowed parties , or have devast@@ ated apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I stood at the front line , when confidence was broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts , if I only think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our biggest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , only a fraction of 123 million nights had a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for people are familiar with each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay , where he suffered a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the area is beautiful , equipped with sufficient hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they don &apos;t want one to feel lonely , they bring books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can even stay longer , without calculating the extra nights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , not every stay is starting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions coinci@@ de ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , it is an economic trading . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now simply to call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people lay a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelling today is to be compared to Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill a group there and show a neighborhood in a pub that you never heard before ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what if we would like to share apartments , from the ground up to join together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would that look like ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if cities would accept the idea of sharing , what would it be ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I imagine cities that enable us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and dis@@ integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; residents were now offered . students , who were looking for a stay , were now offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were im@@ par@@ ted to people whose children had emig@@ rated , and incub@@ ator programs started . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 19@@ 1 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was also the hospitality , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were similar websites in front of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , why did our work just work ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it amazing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost overwhelming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every time there is a red Maz@@ da , I have to think about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or suppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or simply , a delay in the che@@ ating check at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the media represent people who look like me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study , 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; studies show that Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- twice espresso , with cream extra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern fitness fan@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , baby , I was not born . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I decided to do that , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual man , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funny thing was that at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence , compared with the pressure I felt as 17 year old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have not only passed the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was confident and slow , who deep@@ ened himself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I recognize myself in it , I feel God knows me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have you ever felt that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet love somehow ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s how it feels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came that terrible morning in September , 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flying in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should I do something like this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember -- as we drove sil@@ ently -- as deeply I went down to my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week inside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the comprehensive coverage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people who were detained for Muslims , imprisoned and defeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the people attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not easy , to constantly explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to do with questions , I love questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the accus@@ ations that are hard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about my church , like a tumor in the US body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question arises : are we malign@@ ant , or ben@@ ign ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques become more secure ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe a few parking spaces will be released , but do not stop terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regular visit of a mosque also leads to a more tolerant attitude towards people of other beliefs , and to show greater civi@@ c participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised into mos@@ ques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as first , the person is cut off from their congregation , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts do believe that the terrorists are the real Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we would add to their imagination , if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IS has so much to do with Islam , such as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology , on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when looking at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; sacred scrip@@ ture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is their brut@@ ality , which makes them read these things in the Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl came to him , because she had preferred to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she spoke was silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by nothing and something that could make sense of their anger , it was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her congregation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what she learned in the mosque , she was afraid to join the IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was an insight , as Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family are concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formance and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study shows that if you submit test persons messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they agree on military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happened in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war , and during two periods of election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the allocation of collective blame , it is not just about having to explain itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned , saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had post@@ et remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he fired at De@@ ah eight times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did we go to the mosque , or were we safe at home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silent , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , went out of my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw was holding me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people were there , because they had the courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will you join those who think , we are better than those . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia they seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I wonder what to say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thought with drau@@ ght , work in a class@@ y think factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual , I am as usual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims all over the world , people want normal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , in no way I am an exception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists , is short of becoming a billion dollar business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the air package assignment to our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter @-@ high tower from 1 500 bricks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by connecting air devices , they achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ able structures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we would like to show you a few of our new projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of what is possible , in autonomous flight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , one of our laboratories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flying machine , trying to hit two flies with a flap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a restriction of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is recovered , and the performance can be improved by practicing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions which are at the heart of the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which gather to hurt you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decades ago , trained pilots could fly remote @-@ controlled flying devices that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear ru@@ dder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight unit . it was invented recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no other actu@@ ation drives or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens very much so that it can fly stable , and can move everywhere in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the likel@@ ihood of throwing it right now is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do with all this super@@ abundance ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you see , that it is only symmet@@ rical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it receives the external ability , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moving in the room in all directions no matter what direction it is turned , or even as it rot@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are represent@@ able in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this is clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further , albeit limited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will demonstrate this , by keeping one half un@@ fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit knows where in space it is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hopefully , you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Broadway , the particularly safe machine wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for guys like us , the salary is in the development and the creative act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , smart creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.3 billion years ago in a very distant gal@@ axy , two black holes conver@@ ge faster and faster , they converted the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this short moment , they lit bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire us known universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their energy , however , did not put them free in the form of light -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , we speak of black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself , and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let us arrange the events in the first place , at first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just 1.3 billion years ago , several zel@@ liges were created on Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God loves us -- even the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from the MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are caused by black holes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most people thought it crazy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after decades of development , design , design and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the laser inter@@ fer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational wave observ@@ atory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following period , the precision of lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which improved the recognition performance enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , they are called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went through you , and me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and through the detector , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the departure from my ailing father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a wave of gra@@ vit@@ ation is a movement of forces , in the structure of space and time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when moving the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illustr@@ ating the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often perform a really brutal dance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting &quot; stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous , are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and dra@@ ined when hit by the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be precisely measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucleus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of his classic text on gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties during the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 and 42 years before his success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back to Lig@@ o . Scott said , Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is quite practical , because so you can produce an image or a map of things by seeing the light coming around you from several points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in tones , this is different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean you particularly much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , we listen to certain features like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now just said Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ mer Bob &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with them , we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least , Lig@@ o is the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so when we convert wave patterns in sound , we can literally listen to the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to listen to the gra@@ vit@@ ation , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has occupied for quite a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply loop : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same medium with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , shaped into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I &apos;ll never forget -- this sounds as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which are about as fast as the bars of your mixer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AA : let us consider briefly , what this means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we know from it , because we have heard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the remaining importance of Lig@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe , as it never was possible before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this path , we can listen to the All and hear the invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much in space , we can -- practically or fundamentally -- not see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are very useful . of them , we learned a lot about the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exciting physical processes happen , however , in the nucleus that is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will never see through , as these are op@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe but we will never see them because the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own tail light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the aid of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back at the beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of whom we have no idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we didn &apos;t expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the type of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they observed are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are the Sau@@ dis no@@ des for our archaeological work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lig@@ o offers us a completely different perspective on the events in space , on the formation of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the sound and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ideas for new observ@@ atories , a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and All . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say to all &quot; Yes ! &quot; to which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , but yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that , what I was afraid of , removed my fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; my life changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , in an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ bs , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the Beg@@ inning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there I swear to play with them whenever you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : first of all , I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; sa@@ wing for playing with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer . I think things out , aw@@ aken to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I scre@@ amed TV . I produce TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I make television , in great style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this season , I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of programme into the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television programs , 70 hours television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new episode all nine days , four television programs , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production , four episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , four television programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all over the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I own myself and not just produced , so I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one , therefore I &apos;m a Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say it to you that all of you who are working so hard will take a business or home , take me seriously , so that you understand that I &apos;m not just about the computer and fan@@ atic , and it &apos;s true when I say : I don &apos;t dream about dream job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , everything reality , all the blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my work always creates a country , out of nowhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like I placed troops , as painting me on a canvas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so as to carry a high sound , run a marathon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting , fun and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sw@@ um sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people assume that when I explain to them the sums that I speak about writing , writing gives me joy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , it does it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the sums -- when I started to work and work , build and collaborate with television production , I discovered this thing , this sums , this energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums are action and activity , and the sums are a drug . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ zz is music , the sums are light and air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you have such a bu@@ zz , you cannot strive for size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the feeling of not being able to be different to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is called bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I become , the more work , the more things I write , the more I write history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love working isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the sum , the sum , the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like this sum , I love the sw@@ amp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I need the sum , I am the sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I just this sum ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then , the sum stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burnt out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single work@@ book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum was stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t love my job anymore , the engine was off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I made the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , continuous weekends , no shame , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan sleeps not , does not give up with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was the bu@@ zz , and the sw@@ amp was me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hypo@@ critical author @-@ titanium &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know you &apos;re doing it you &apos;re doing , you love what you &apos;re doing , a ban@@ ker , a mother to be , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz , who is you then ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; puts me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I want to say no , when I am aware of two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; cats . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hate it when I am Titan and mo@@ urn my hum@@ ming , and here everything changes from my own eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we play and play her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of breath , can I do nothing except to watch out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax pen@@ cils and the song in which it is letting go of , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air in this place is so tight , that I can barely breathe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental door goes , and an energy ub comes in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that wasn &apos;t immediately , but it happened that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel it .
the sw@@ amp slowly comes back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the sums , but a bu@@ zz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now , I feel like I know a magical secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum , the work sum , the titanium walls , this is just the replacement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I travel through broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sums are no force , and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ zz is the current , which comes from lust for life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , expectation and pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the sums again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing is not enough for me , how to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the truth hur@@ ts !
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this admission is painful , for what is better for a person than to be home ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I am too relaxed , none of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we make small dance parties
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , I feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I always travel to my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe meet me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I play and play until I ask myself , why have we ever stopped playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can also ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe you think nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are right , but you can do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have time !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna , or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it &apos;s only 15 minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if my teen@@ ie &apos;s daughter speaks with me for 15 minutes , then I am the mother of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 15 minutes , more you don &apos;t need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can get 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready for prayer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my children are my aff@@ lu@@ ent , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is necessary to feel the hum@@ ming to have a place for peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about &quot; playing &quot; in general .
take the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find out , and keep it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll finish and be victorious . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to out@@ do myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not treat yourself in 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the sw@@ um seems to return , if I &apos;m not working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
working does not work without games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes time but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the sum , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not the sum , the sum is not me ... no more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my sw@@ amp .
the sums of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that I &apos;m a titanium . I have never seen a titanium , the trip to Jerusalem is playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I said to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yet , I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the more I play the better I work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum . the land I run , the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the bu@@ zz , the sum , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new life feel within me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I feel this tot@@ ality , the more I know who I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a writer . I think of things , I stir you to life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is the dream of this job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , Tit@@ ans have no chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a severe stroke or after a car accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have permanent , severe disability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in this process , an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons circuits so that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease , which suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , I was chief doctor , working day and night in the emergency room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trauma , the brain swelling and the cran@@ ial pressure increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaving cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to very small children taken out of your families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and surroundings to thri@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps you know from the biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into each cell type of the organism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active , they share very quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they slowly shared themselves , and after a few weeks they even died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the stage of the fet@@ us , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , why stay they preserved ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we do not know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them at higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is clear , however -- we got our stem cells from these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stand before a potential cell source , which enables brain healing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then mark them in color , in order to be able to track them in the brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last step , we pl@@ ung@@ ed them at the receiving table of the same individual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we pl@@ anti@@ ate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first scenario we planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they were completely disappeared as if they were taken back home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second scenario , we provided an injury to and sam@@ pled exactly the same cells and now the cells stayed -- they grow up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ ung@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we colored in vitro , in culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they did that very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor @-@ area in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at some degree , just like the monkeys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , they see the monkey , which spontaneously recovered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not that precise , and not so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , see when we planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the Rei@@ m@@ plantation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can tell you , that were also very exciting results for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have fi@@ gured out a lot more about these cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ete them in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really hope , that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : that &apos;s understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will the agency allow us to start it soon ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it takes a long time to choose the patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the West , we make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable ge@@ dness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe capitalism , inevitably , leads to democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , democracy dimin@@ ishes among us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambig@@ uous to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not influence the austerity programs that were realized in Greece .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ aked friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Chinese Communist Party and even the Euro@@ group , could save us democracy but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because without democracy , our societies are becoming mi@@ gh@@ tier , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies wasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the subject of waste , I want to remind you of an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all recognize the debt mountain
but few recognise his twin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mountain of unused cash , which is too fearful to invest it where it would be productive and income where it would be productive and produce all the things humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past 3 months , in the US , England and the euro zone , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , railway tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US Dollar sounds much money until it compar@@ es with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time revol@@ ves around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except stock markets and to drive up real estate prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe , who fear that his son would kill him if he grows up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily the circumstances bring about , which cause the body to kill him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is my hatred , with capitalism -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but before we proceed , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy , of course , included too many -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was the right to freedom of expression , rather than the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which it granted them the right to political participation in questions of the state of affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long , -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a candle , which is very bright , it is burned out quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the liberal democracy only arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was limited to politics , while the economy -- therefore the world of corporations -- became a democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by gradually acceler@@ ating politics and escap@@ ing it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wondering why the politicians are no longer the same , as before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is because today it can be in the government , and still not in power because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mentioned my hatred , with capitalism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably depl@@ etes the animals from which it feeds , that it star@@ ves at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the economic demand falls and the managers of corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash in their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ assemble politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a new idea , by the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago , and it did not go very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teaching from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position like in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin peaks raises the tw@@ ins , and the social conflicts are deeper than I believe -- in countries such as China will come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and ensure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , therefore , is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in machines , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , we must be optimistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so what would it need to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the business sector : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one works -- is the property of those who work in the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour are completely obsol@@ ete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein , and employees who work there , but no longer between capital and labor , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin peaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the sphere of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency that is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; in the interests of all of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem was that at that time , it was not the technical means to implement it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we have , in particular , against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world I describe is at the same time liberal , in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and work in the bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; matrix , &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ies ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer depends on how we decide politically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marxi@@ sts in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will create such a massive decline in macro@@ economic demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is absolutely relevant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally ins@@ ane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : actually , and now we are probably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers have told you very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view on China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy for politics , while the area where most of it happens -- the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some ways , if I can say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for -- remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was particularly scep@@ tical , concerning democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to present China now , to do what the West has done for itself in the 19th century , smells tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : I am sure , that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first six months ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal point of view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only Greece , but the euro zone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say goodbye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro zone , have chosen the denial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but when the changes occur it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG , for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who says in office after 6 months , especially in such tense situation , he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believed that there was an honest interest on the side of the don@@ ors to find a common solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the charges imposed by the euro@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did not want to admit that they had been cat@@ astrop@@ hic in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika , who imposed this policy on us , stood up : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have disa@@ strous consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we allow ourselves to enter the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be intol@@ erable for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BG , we hope you &apos;ll be wrong in this point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for visiting TE@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Roy Price most of them have never heard , even though he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that goes back to the decision , which Roy met three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is senior executive at Amazon Studios
the TV production company of Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ atine and refers to Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are so many TV series , that Roy cannot choose any . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are quite right on that corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and shows how many shows get this review .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if your show is valued at nine and above , it will be a winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are shows like Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive when you have seen a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of those episodes ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is not about getting into the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he makes more thoughts about the average stimulation , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , he must make sure that he is really on the right side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time Amazon is doing something like that , so Roy Price wants to risk nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and releases them online where everyone can look for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if Amazon is out for nothing , is it possible to use correctly ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are observed by Roy and his team , who are recording everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ ps or look again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce , with these data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact they collect the data , process this and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many people can &apos;t remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of staging a competition , he and his team have looked at the available data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers so the ratings they give the shows their course , what shows they like etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the spectators : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have two very competitive , data @-@ based companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because logic somehow states , that it should work with everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has 200 years of statistics , as Back @-@ Up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when data analysis does not work so it is somewhat sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health Systems company here ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is in prison here in the U.S. and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al takes place or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , there is evidence of this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always the best results are produced , and this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the most experienced companies are wrong , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind can predict -- by data analysis of Google searches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked wonderfully , and was a great news rating . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , at work , in medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people use lots of data to make serious choices as deciding for a cancer therapy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , I realized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to solve a complex problem , mainly two things : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , you put the items together to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you have to do so several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts again , and then come to a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do , but the decision on how to put all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they had a big personal risk with that decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then as they chose Alpha House as a show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before there were data , this was the device for decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , I will f@@ rank it with a technical demo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have made some decisions in my life , and I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with a little bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data still pays off , make decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
