<seg id="2">"" "" "" "you may know him, because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "long before someone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA was illegally owned by Americans." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "however, it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence service, in which the CIA literally handed over to Iran drafts for a nuclear bomb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "if that sounds nuts, read it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and to spy on journalists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous they give up." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "but then, only days before the trial, something extraordinary happened." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "suddenly, although they were for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "the reason: in the time of electronic surveillance, the reporters and sources can hide less and less." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "and so the investigators, without his agreement, have kept his telephone links secretly," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit, and even travel notes with the list of his flights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blocker and Risen's supposed source." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "unfortunately, this is only one of many cases." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned more than all U.S. governments before him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is downgrading too much of its work." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">"" "" "" "since 11 September, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game that is to be protected by the first constitutional addition, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy out all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "but just as technology allows the government to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "and indeed, they can do so from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "today there are communication software, which has not yet been written as a crack and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "this technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "there you can upload documents or send information, just as in any usual contact form." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "so the government can no longer obtain information secretly, and many of the information they would ask would not be available from the outset." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "SecureDrop is, however, only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">"" "" "" "unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger us all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have an opportunity to shew misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower," "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "or the next environmental officer, who wants to report the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"" "" "" "leaving cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to very small children taken out of your families." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="835">"" "" "" "they slowly shared themselves, and after a few weeks they even died." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="836">"" "" "" "so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>

<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did that very well.</seg>

<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>

<seg id="955">"" "" "" "the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin peaks raises the twins, and the social conflicts are deeper than I believe -- in countries such as China will come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="956">"" "" "" "so we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and ensure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the film" matrix "like a documentary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="957">"" "" "" "the question, therefore, is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="958">"" "" "" "the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of" Star Trek, "in machines, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athener" Agora. "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="959">"" "" "" "I believe, we must be optimistic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it need to look like this "Star Trek" like utopia instead of the "matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"" "" "" "in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples soon." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="962">"" "" "" "in the business sector: please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while working and in which your capital follows you from one place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one works -- is the property of those who work in the company." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "then, all income from capital and revenues and the concept of wage labour are completely obsolete." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="964">"" "" "" "no distinction between those who belong to the company but not work therein, and employees who work there, but no longer between capital and labor, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin peaks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="965">"" "" "" "in the sphere of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency that is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging markets] in the interests of all of humanity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos" in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "" "" "imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">"" "" "" "the problem was that at that time, it was not the technical means to implement it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today, we have, in particular, against the background of a reunified policy and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">"" "" "" "the world I describe is at the same time liberal, in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and work in the bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="973">"" "" "" "but above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "" "" "or will we sink into a" matrix, "similar dystopies?" "" "" ""</seg>
