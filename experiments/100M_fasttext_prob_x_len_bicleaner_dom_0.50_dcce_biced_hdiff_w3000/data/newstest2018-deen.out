&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards , which change your view of the city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Ir@@ ren institution , where young people today should meet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a v@@ ault chapel , which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small gar@@ den@@ ers work for the former cause of peasants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date , it gets nervous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everybody knows everyone who had to upset me , because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i took a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich @-@ based Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work , which one cannot recognize as such . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large overview map , more detailed maps , so @-@ called origin@@ als , were incorporated into cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were created according to the Bavarian Palace Department , between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your patron : Napoleon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria , of course for military purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the French troops finally dra@@ fted with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reis@@ su@@ e of Munich came from 18@@ 56 , and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to Early Modern / Today , the state capital is most impressive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming , a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written number numbered copies of the so @-@ called &quot; primitive &quot; from which the basic income was derived . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no farmers nowadays , but small farmers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large green area , north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , stands out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October Festival , was indeed still a meadow - and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district , in the area of today &apos;s district , one reads not only the street name &quot; on the guest &apos;s cake &quot; or &quot; on the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ haus &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ beck &quot; was founded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was advanced for his time and ended for example buying the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 280 patients , space was first , later extended to 500 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k facility in hair 1905 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , is located there since 2006 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Institute , young people now meet in Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and transformed it into a youth hostel with educational establishments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in an architectural style based on the original construction of the Irish village , which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 56 , the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Second World War brought a decisive change , even in the heart of Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a grave chapel from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line was held on 5 April 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the slider , the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial image of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
civil rights group publishes travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Association for Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people , who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks from the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for special attention to Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to prosec@@ ute discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who dis@@ associate the itinerary , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first such warning , which the organization has issued for a state in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i without being accused of a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council also points out a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI report program of the FBI , who classified the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th position of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for residential or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States ple@@ dged immigration laws to arrest people due to immigration violations , which will contribute to further retirement benefits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turn@@ key project is elementary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ con@@ n project is a success project , and will continue next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary group Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the G@@ Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the CD@@ U village association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave an insight into his operations , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and also home to five apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Wal@@ nut milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este is exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ chairman of Fisch@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on such steep areas , I can &apos;t work profit@@ ably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much more must be worked with the sense of the motor sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not lead a biogas plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the meaning of the fence project and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one hope , that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be pulled out for quite a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the support , farmers often stand in criticism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares , which cannot be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total cost of EUR 71 500 was funded by half the leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the farmers stayed 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter White stood firm : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape conservation guidelines ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will allow the state support of f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prerequisite is the presence of a subsi@@ dy , designated by L@@ PR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the area to be fenced must not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( incl@@ ination above 35 percent ) and must be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ ching project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other , therefore the car@@ elessly staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump Regime , knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the proposals made by the President for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a hor@@ de of bo@@ aters and liberty @-@ insul@@ ators would have killed him , if he had done it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he took their importance , and in particular the importance it was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it , it is not really about history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable fall of your rich coasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the basis of their death , knew very well that they took a highly political action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism , by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn classical illustration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup , and a disa@@ strous attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued that the Statue of Liberty was no one , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives who took the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled on something here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the importance of the statue is , completely , a question of the standpoint of perception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen from the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope , and the welcome they must hear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that is , of course , not the prospect of ever acknowled@@ ging Miller and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their torch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but the hatred which is their only source of power to ign@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oses Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the Great Britain team
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue to carry it out until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also with the type at the street corner , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is chosen by the team as team captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought about naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winners , who will compete for the 400 m hur@@ dles in their fifth world champi@@ onships , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British crew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past year , the Mittel@@ stand Mu@@ ir will lead to five British and two European records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch for a great season , which included victory at the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships , as the only other fleet in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team captain says she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , but knowing that my team@@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning my speech , as a captain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it is really important to rely on this home support , and to benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office , if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he kno@@ cked on the cri@@ tique , sure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , accused him from the beginning of this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it is especially important , if it is a type like Ho@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has shown a strong hand in the leadership of his state , and strict adher@@ ence to the principles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his elec@@ tors , and to de@@ vise his hair @-@ less head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum known as being officially designated and dangerous by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Gover@@ nor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people , which vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ iting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priest quoted the Bible in his post , and appealed to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful but she asked for hate crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely said that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other topical news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and are not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees described as &quot; concentrated &quot; spam attack &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or del@@ eting a negative comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times when you did the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , and to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gan is not the first public official , who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump is accused of Twitter users , blocked by his Twitter feed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell in Virginia last week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors des Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable Port had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous wall@@ ets fought on his leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who use pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project , peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised its position on the Am@@ ity Treaty , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he did not silence them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comforts in the next three days , since the Renaissance Club held the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open in East Lot@@ hi@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Nor@@ di@@ re who last year at the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round led before he lost against Paul E@@ ales and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best site , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a jeal@@ ous advocate of this game , and is proud of his performance here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I gained it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour following his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the promotion on homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish gig since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r said the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy as to how far it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admission is free , parking costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passi@@ vity in lung cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this result , scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come from a study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates 1,@@ 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are attributable to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a comparison , he drew up an own study on this issue from 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; said the head of the building , Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of mountains in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traffic , which is still obstruc@@ ting the construction works , is a major problem for the building of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off grids is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road is closed , and only the regular buses are entitled to pass through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold@@ land
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after half an hour the stolen lion is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the earth floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a bucket in an homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her fields were not assigned to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 people were to vote against the occupying troops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta who maintains control over the region and exclude foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2003 , the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua , while the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprised the eastern part of the island . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a 5 @-@ hour drive by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses that are surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated sheets that were transformed into various yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and virtually no for@@ eigner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we weren &apos;t used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously we had only sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ anti@@ acy and liter@@ acy rates in Asia have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the amount of wood resources worth $ 78 billion is estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these riches are however a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ tian demands for greater autonomy threaten those golden go@@ ose , and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 associates have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army since 1969 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recru@@ it All , &quot; it is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric attacks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; screws have increased , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources provide an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens are sold fried chicken and ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the migrants have begun selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cost the native Papua ( Mama @-@ Mama &apos;s women &#93; from Papua , their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua with his election campaign in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inaugur@@ ation in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the frigh@@ tened kids told them , that they should turn on their head@@ lights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the soldiers took their tone , and later returned to four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their ri@@ fle @-@ bombs , said sacrifices and witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into the coma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things escal@@ ated the following day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1,000 young Papua , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to challenge justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance , running in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some prot@@ esters started throwing stones on police and military posts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the mood was heated , a command was sent over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses perform more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released by the local media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ama , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his bri@@ ghtly painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kay@@ ama still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was crowded , lots of shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to be sure that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who bears as many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said that his officers only wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the spokesman for the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings arrived only on the following day , &quot; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three weeks ago , Jok@@ ow@@ i held an im@@ passion@@ ed speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical ab@@ norm@@ alities in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will not happen in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 , that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historic human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some were in the 90 , and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused of crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody war of independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights have already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims , with fierce un@@ belief . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was four times inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that years later , he still lives in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his brother Y@@ ac@@ omo repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear , to discuss the incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a building contractor who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
stir@@ red villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw rocks on officers who re@@ acted by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness how the injured are quickly delivered here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile Brig@@ ade of the police in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ ling of the Indonesian government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the Free Papua movement ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a , fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can work on four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they retain the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a were only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , economic inequality between the native Papua and the new migrants has grown , since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport in greater numbers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs in the region , usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rarely capital or necessary skills to make their own businesses competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Executive Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far away from Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , restrictions of reporting international media are tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua , despite the rare permission to film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s election campaign have not been realized to promote transparency and development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists attempting to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled eastern provinces of Papua and West documents : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , so that it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local people want more foreign governments to take note of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , on 4 May , the local people broke their silence and urged him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the predicted that they will probably not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kiss , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Executive Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being alive under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; debt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sho@@ oting made a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in a terrain closely opposite the police and the military station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they know they will never come to justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 3@@ 37 metres high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the second fire that is sweeping through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which one inci@@ dently calls the Tor@@ ch Tower ( torch tower ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dub@@ ai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting broke out against 4,@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and the buildings cool down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government said , they work on providing shelter to those affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident can rel@@ a@@ unch questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , the outer covering for decoration or isolation came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Britain , the police said that the system of plates to isol@@ ate and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has passed through its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup @-@ Individu@@ al was only supported by two @-@ thirds of the two @-@ thirds majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although often very long , but even so cher@@ ished five @-@ sentence classics are thus preserved for the traditional competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 % of the member states voted for reform , the objective of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore barely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members will not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , one will continue to work to improve the application . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal came to carry out the final in a neutral place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to reduce the cost of the organis@@ er , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1 of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find out a survey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among passenger passengers revealed that more than 20 percent were deliberately smu@@ g@@ gled to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration &apos;s control points , including at least 6 percent , which were in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently carrying knives or other items with blades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less than 1 percent claimed they had been later discovered that they were accidentally traveling with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey conducted at more than 1,000 people was carried out by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers would rather ignore the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those surve@@ yed that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent millenni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common objects that have been intentionally passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 3 percent reported to have carried things with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of women surve@@ yed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought forbidden drugs into the aircraft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it questioned travellers across the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought through the airport security , and how many would have done it intentionally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that the people who smu@@ dge smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through the safety , those that fly the most frequently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are often unsure which liquids they may take with you , or how much of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is no surprise that the bulk of the liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a while , the people thought that T@@ SA might look at books as smu@@ g@@ gling goods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ on Mus@@ k , it doesn &apos;t matter : ten thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 , &quot; electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a of El@@ on Mus@@ k will be happy to answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , he has previously agreed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the constantly triumph@@ ant figures for sales increases and even more col@@ os@@ sal sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k revealed a different , less brilliant figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quarterly assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often come with the more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ k now ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 pounds ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are available at a telephone conference with analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Tes@@ la supplied 8@@ 4.000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if there are greater delays , then the un@@ linking of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because then , the company cannot prevent un@@ cont@@ ented customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt is reti@@ ring due to the hes@@ itation of the provisions of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a day after being accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , res@@ igned its former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not notice the complaint , which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a deadline which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil erosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for a year to his authority to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was by President Donald Tr@@ ump County State of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of tough@@ er environmental regulations for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regul@@ arities to the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itts regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator passed his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce meth@@ anol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administration , the EPA has often failed the deadlines for carrying out and then been waiting to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in a regulation through court proceedings and we take fri@@ es seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive collection of o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month should delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

tum@@ ors celebrate 750 years of the Church of Hil@@ arius
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 750 Years of the Church of Hil@@ arius : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical church of Hil@@ arius is a popular place to stay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village treasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the year 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ gt@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the certificate according to the certificate , on the Tum@@ ble Berg , besides the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard with which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not vice versa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there were also people there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; the third , the magnificent sett@@ ler of the village . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old maps , dating back to 1600 , confirm these historical conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval property law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a master , who built a church and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this connection , the right to use a pastor or a bishop was to propose a new priest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bigger ones of the two were broken at Christmas , 16@@ 73 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newly created bell sounded in 16@@ 92 for the first time , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were cut and the bell @-@ parts were stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the roof was le@@ aking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs , and used them as fire@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 23 , the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm broke the church tower and half fell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only today &apos;s tower , which is still existing today , has remained as a witness of the 750 years of the history of the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ alle berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of the &quot; creative pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as organizers invite the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is designed by the Com@@ bo des Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium , Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to end the Ser@@ en@@ ade , there is a drink in front of the cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over the meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers look out the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius line , which is of importance for tumours and audi@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the friends and sponsors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to their home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
association wants to have permission of wind turbines to be examined
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim fights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refra@@ ins &quot; from taking back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days earlier - but the district government Düsseldorf did not approve it because of a defect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the approval allowance is still illegal and therefore also declined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , President of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided to have a wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letter has been received by the quad@@ r@@ atic since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the circle takes it for the occasion , to examine the matter again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday decided not to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of the NE@@ W , plans to construct four 200 metres of high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the power demand of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NE@@ W Re wants to invest around 20 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer there was a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on L 3@@ 33 , between Nieder@@ bau@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman was injured in a deadly condition .
two more people were slightly injured .
the road remained closed for hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her car as a companion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city and De@@ aler Plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ itors and people from the region will discover the shops in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial association and the city administration will take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to attract the inhabitants to the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the chairman of the commercial club , Christian König , announced the &quot; Heimat shopping &quot; weekend , the customers should sensi@@ ti@@ ze what offers their own city is available away from the usual supermarket product . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market , is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their training places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops will invite the city centre to the &quot; Christmas shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the surrounding region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the trade association and the city enter a further stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to well as well as sold Sunday , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attractive offers on Saturday , and the wai@@ ver of parking charges on this day are part of the concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , customer potential should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also many locals would have lost the city centre , when shopping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to the land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had partly spread , king in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities are participating at the nationwide &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should promote the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the I@@ HK , and with many partners , also makes it clear that every citizen can influence their purchasing behaviour in a direct environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. School
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during construction work , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them severely damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a wounded in critical condition was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a first missing , later , was also found dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead , it was the cler@@ k of the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a failure , the authorities suspected of working on a gas line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the holiday period , only a few people stayed in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump put on pressur@@ ized tran@@ scription of telephone calls , Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scriptions of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly den@@ ounced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and disclosed a tense exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull says that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was ridi@@ culous &quot; &quot; dum@@ my &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the USA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mer@@ cury launched a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , emerged a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle thread suit - took a long train on his ci@@ gar , looking at the wind@@ shield . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inside , the occup@@ ants were ho@@ vering in fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tore the silence , as a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reflection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met a real si@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really impossible that in all these years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia , and a life long civil rights activ@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , it serves as a dramatic appeal to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want war crimes , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court physician places a towel over the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to FBI records received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding Gra@@ f@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI &apos;s black Far@@ mp@@ ant Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , settled during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ ors were in the city that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y , and that the baby she wore was not of her husband . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when they arrived from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch mo@@ b surrounding the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , includes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings and made evidence of the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a massacre &quot; massacre , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has directed the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping and rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that it is no longer existed in America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to watch , and hard to look at , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve been through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - entered a room and listened to a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ade Mar@@ dan@@ gh is a co @-@ director , here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he played the role of the boss @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ dan@@ u@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side of the room , the actors rehear@@ sed Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester is scre@@ aming and pushing him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs most lou@@ dly .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I simply don &apos;t think that white people back then &apos;@@ n@@ -- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the scene will start again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed up with a dream of mourning , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and brings Bil@@ lie Holidays a mourning ceremony &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears in their eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience is almost evenly distributed between black and white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gian humidity almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if you stand on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the last notes of the song end up , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wants to remember it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actors cast the ly@@ n@@ ch rope away , and wipe their tears off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w embra@@ ces Mar@@ dan@@ gling , the man in suit , who played the clan member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks in their arms weeping , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you did that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the audience gets together with the actors for dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a table , a white pair of Atlan@@ ta talks about the post@@ age with a black couple that they just got to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which emotion left the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; today this is called the only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone thinks Broo@@ ks &apos; yard at his table , he eats and re@@ members the civil rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , he started planning the performance next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the delivery is in some ways inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf is setting up a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ ov@@ et@@ ted street corner including the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; poster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from East times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine @-@ guards pos@@ ing as Rock@@ ef@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acked oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; Ring &quot; production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhein@@ fatal - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize perfectly as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood show@@ cases a cor@@ pse in the trunk and put the ri@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the bril@@ li@@ antly colorful Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight bo@@ xer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brut@@ ally the scene , when he was Siegfried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) has to believe it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bly squee@@ zed his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - given the great heat back in casual casual clothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a source of the Pfei@@ f@@ Concer@@ to over himself , there were five years later , in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls were going down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner should have been happy about this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said just before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their voluntary year , they work in several places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
where everywhere ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I am helping here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I have also worked in the open whole day at school , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what are your experiences with that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ day volunteer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it come about ?
amount : I have taken Ab@@ itur .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully abor@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , I realised that it is the wrong and I want to do something different , work with people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point perhaps , really . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and was it like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount : I collected some great impressions , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will study dual , probably do a social worker training in the Youth Department Her@@ ne and study at the University of Applied Sciences in Ham@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it is very variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it always depends on where to do the FS@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is possible to make it from anti@@ quity to youth work , in all possible facets of social work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in civil engineering ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , this is not a question of calculating sta@@ sis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always other people in front of the head , who have a completely different story behind them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether a refugee , whether a young person from the family has been taken out of the family - must always be dealt with individually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quantity : for that , I &apos;m not the guy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lots of love , much kindness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also negative moments , but life is just like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son cuts more than 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce more than 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure with which the company is facing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job cuts , the Director @-@ General John Fall@@ on , mainly announced for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to his previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ gu@@ in Rand@@ om House , said that the outlook for the financial year remained unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killing a NATO soldiers and injured several others , say officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured , shared an explanation of NATO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h neighborhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killing two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NATO &apos;s opinion is that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened , as a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statement , all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban said they were attacking this attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting military and police in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul also have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government and its policies and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that the states are obliged to reduce the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to push ahead with the &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said that it will show the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we react to our state partners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which toxic emissions are to be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - a year to October 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a broad range of environmental conditions imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature groups who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA has said that inhal@@ ation of air , which contains o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municip@@ ality of Flu@@ e @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a communal space in the future retirement home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing land part is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the area is still owned by the church community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be financed by a private investor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the ground floor , it would provide space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council flo@@ ats to see such a common space not as a meeting point only for residents of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current budget , will be offset by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the establishment of a common area would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the resolution suggests that in this respect , there is no bil@@ lets between the legs - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - if possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unnecessary , so don &apos;t just mean Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it helps : unanim@@ ously , it happens to the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not move so well , they lean back in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room , but absolutely against a municipal involvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it , it sees a hidden sub@@ vention of any wealthy or even foreign investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the area , there is no surplus , but a real counter@@ value in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ger &apos;s proposal to track the resolution accordingly , has three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains the same with two counter@@ parts in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; if we put the decision in such a way , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car collision : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and was seriously injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path along the road Black @-@ way road from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer , Bus@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for him , a passenger car driver who is travelling the same direction granted him priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the landing fields went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he joined a car , headed by a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man was thrown onto the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suffered severe injury , and was brought to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting carriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
FC Bayern Munich has to abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without him , the Super@@ cup takes place : David Al@@ aba must get the game against Dortmund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with personnel , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the German soccer champion Bayern Munich is getting bigger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti doesn &apos;t have to do without the B@@ V@@ B also on David Al@@ aba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this confirmed the Italian , on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has held the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have great confidence , that my team shows these qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intensive game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts fans in their spell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
immig@@ rated star to star in the resin
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin , the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is planned by the &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a planet path in Göttingen , Germany , since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star nature trail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is coming to meet the needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members want to place tables along the planned route , and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the information on the panels is to be supplemented by internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the star@@ path train will be extended by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star grew stronger than another , even though it was essentially farther away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , in which con@@ stellation a selected star can be found and when it is best to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the university city since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star@@ ver@@ g - the planet road since 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ den Hotel at Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system the Plan@@ etary path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stel@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to , degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet , are positioned precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the earth shr@@ inks so on a 6.5 @-@ mil@@ lim@@ eter sphere , while the sun is measuring exactly 75 metres away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the light takes about eight hours from the sun to the Plu@@ to , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ fe@@ ather @-@ weight champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through a unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko defended his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the pair pos@@ ing for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mate noticed that a possible show@@ down would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; called Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ s &#91; to 140 l@@ bs &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he must move to light wei@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate talks asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must cont@@ end with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , which is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he appreciated Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous warri@@ or , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko insisted with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the three combat champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks &quot; very slowly &quot; I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show punch strength , then speakers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both said they could feel the momentum , which was built for their own struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ on@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured to tire plat@@ ter
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured in part badly on Thursday afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle before 16.@@ 30 in front of the connector market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car sh@@ ook to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ turned and then remained on the roof of the green stri@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were badly injured during the accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be guided by the accident site on the left side of the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ alogue works better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 to the start of the season against Br@@ uns@@ wick , that the optimisation of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , but would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the supply chain should also be optimized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a gate after a free kick , the For@@ tun@@ en do not want to capture any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be so that no one besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) is on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hoffmann is convinced that after the experience in preparation with the tri@@ ke , his team is better able to cope better than with the four @-@ chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , but that we do better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t have so many play@@ mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ leading start , don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance might be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we have four points on Sunday and we can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I checked the start into the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who didn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; said Radio and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might be even more fresh as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at present , &quot; says the President of the Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , guests from the Rhin@@ eland are going to be a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , &quot; says Radio , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which one has to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meeting such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , Funk@@ y wants to experience his players in no way on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new Results of Swedish Asyl@@ um App@@ lic@@ ers Test Publ@@ ished
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest results of test for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( medic@@ in@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ kat@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rat@@ ernity Protection ) was critici@@ zed for the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees , which were minor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until today , Mig@@ ration@@ ale has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in more 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency stated that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person was &quot; possibly under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the examined person is 18 years old or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det reviewed the 5@@ 81 published results , she found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person openly told that she was 18 years old this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method of medical age evaluation , when X @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot tell it sure , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg is progres@@ sing well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going well , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , head of construction manager at the Department of Road Construction and Traffic in the Regi@@ ment of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in April , work began at the same time on all three necessary bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the end of the project is scheduled for October , and Lei@@ cht is sure the schedule is respected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has got a 1.@@ 30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a marginal fastening , which is also used as an operating system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a 2.8 metres wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the pedestrian walk@@ way is to be gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the special feature is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
a particular finger @-@ tip feeling has required the laying of pipes through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to the work , the residents were informed about the project by hand notes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is later@@ ally regulated by a traffic light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road is completely closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for the three anch@@ or@@ age units amount to 700@@ ,000 euros together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest with German potato salad
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not so common that parties pull together , but if it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under one hat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the parties represented in the chal@@ k of volcan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , left ) belong to a broad alliance that appeals to this day in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the top duo for the parliamentary elections on 24 September , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ athletes , but to demonstrate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colourful . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally the town picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain , but now takes place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colourful picture that can be found there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair of the Forum A World and one of the organizers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ancient German potato salad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario home@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ o reports , he tried to do such an event and get the supplement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a refusal because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ ore is happy that we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also happening : at 20 o &apos;clock in the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle numerous speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ elic Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k talking about their speeches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event , the guests at the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can do nothing - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trumpet meets trumpet
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ maker Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the series of Has@@ la@@ cher clo@@ ister concerts tomorrow , Sunday at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Schwar@@ zw@@ ald , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ka &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter , at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , is the solo instrument of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both combines the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this core of the program was first performed in Freiburg , with a huge success in Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially for the two musicians , and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is deliberately incorporated into the concert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart very openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s coming next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the probably most famous relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleagues , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette of Dar@@ stell@@ i was in love with the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in love with everyone whom I hated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never confused me , or hin@@ dered me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked it , not being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but during school , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really hurt me , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I was eleven I told me the children , I would look like a boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think to myself : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to declare their love life : &quot; people expect you to show yourself in a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump , previously announced a great announcement at West Virginia rally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the country , was elected in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ bes reports that he has coal mines in five states , and a coal business inherited from his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party which would prevent us from working on making our country great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party that is from top to bottom and is not able to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; said the C@@ BS News statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing scandal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , commen@@ ded on Thursday what he described as an excuse from Russia on a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that the exile of his country was correct out of sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut away from competitions Gold@@ - and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized by itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do all kinds to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that start Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ adjustment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dro@@ go &apos;s tests are still insufficient and banned trainers are still free , he said re@@ porters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldier Story for Mali , crashed in Mali &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a funeral service in the North @-@ Hessen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city , under high security measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the still un@@ explained cause of the crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they called the two opposite drivers , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ ili@@ zer from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday , a week ago in the West African Mali . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany , accompanied by a mur@@ dering of the German army in Saint Peter &apos;s Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at noon , only the relatives of the church took leave . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the German Federal Ar@@ med Forces , Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes laid down roses , the relatives were poor in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen described the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; highly decorated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flying operation of the fighting helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six educated tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regi@@ ment , belonging to the soldiers , said : &quot; if these cre@@ ws were not able to turn off the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Prime Minister of the Le@@ yen : the commitment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were taken from the cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want grave near his wife
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed by the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Queen said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You agree with her husband &apos;s decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret , that he was not happy with his title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired , and also presented the title &quot; Crown Prince . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hen@@ rik did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - also not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he likes the country , for which he has worked for the last 50 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French nobility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his almost 50 years of reg@@ ent@@ ment in the Dan@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik expressed about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Danish was wa@@ ving , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk threads instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoked in instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals , I could not hope for a review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was different .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I seemed to be happy with this position , and not ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of a possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke on Friday &apos;s resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the official date of the election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce single @-@ vote majority in parliament on the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests , former Green party , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to record her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had a total of 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the relationship has been reversed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Parliament will be elected regular on January 14 , next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether to go@@ vern this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , makes it essential that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Constitution also sees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s Parliament el@@ ects the trust , and sel@@ ects a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our Constitution provides several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be insp@@ ected legally , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all the questions in peace if they are legally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ we@@ ens &quot; step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens called on the absurd parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land of land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of course assume that she returns to the country &apos;s mandate , which she has received through the green state list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president , Green An@@ ja P@@ iel , said : &quot; we greatly depl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately chose to lead no pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no content differences we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the overthrow of the Dutch Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties , El@@ ke T@@ ests , to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to re @-@ elect the Land@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Lower Saxony , the withdrawal of T@@ we@@ eds costs the majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politicians in their last vanity and in their fru@@ stration put their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat out of it political capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch Prime Minister Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jackets to fal@@ si@@ fy the result of the 2013 election year with personal career gifts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U was before the SPD strongest force , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the parliament day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from greed , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , Minister of Agriculture , is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to watch the eggs in your fridge , and check the stamp on the stamp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ cau@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the eggs affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
infected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , if after all we know currently , a health hazard is virtually excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture .
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , my house has switched off immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just as the manufacturers make sure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the non @-@ residue content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ polluted eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the factories are not to blame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are production plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production companies do not meet directly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they have to expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the event of a serious incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there only a lack of staff , or at the conclu@@ sive competence ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there were just the official controls that revealed the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be excluded 100 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; precisely for this reason , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have made it clear already several times that I expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get food safe and safe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the imp@@ lied measure , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basically , the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ or@@ il in keeping food @-@ safe animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on all levels , it must be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all relevant authorities to ensure that the facts are solved quickly and without gaps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the football rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded expendi@@ tures of the European football clubs will not distur@@ b the world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris Saint Ger@@ main , France . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A because the leading organization controlling the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious champion league tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G can easily make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ scores and brings him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the power @-@ rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate sources of income that enable them to play the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former French player believed that clubs that had taken enormous debts in their quest for success were effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debts of the clubs to the monitoring of their losses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year period of the FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although Plat@@ ini died in favor of the Pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are off from excessive spending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be reported in the financial statements for the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could attempt to outs@@ m@@ art their financial supervision by blowing up their income through companies , which are associated with the owners of a club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while a sian company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as legitimate income . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exactly this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was reported that some of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come over payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be am@@ bass@@ adors and an unprecedented manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to find out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people familiar with the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million , with a turnover of € 5@@ 4@@ 2.4 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; he said on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play , because one can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced Swiss chocolate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the internal cooperation is in front of a potential end : the airline re@@ writes the order anew . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss @-@ speaking driver Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the products were reviewed every two to three years , subjected to quality control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed chocolate bars of 14 grams , each year , distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing on the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the cost , the Swiss did not want to provide any information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume according to &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland , &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual sales of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer , it is a prestigious order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as many applicants for the new tender offer , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y intends to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2006 , the Swiss Cho@@ col@@ ate Panels are distributed on board their flights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Swiss closed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has delivered chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate manufacturers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on long haul flights , the customers of the First Class are p@@ am@@ pered by the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also on the short circuit Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels as if time is scar@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained a original story for a promising ose vegetables that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thinking middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - still manage the im@@ possibility to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who are now adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character goes through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &apos; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy vi@@ cious P@@ lot that is included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Unter@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ one of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repe@@ ating &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I see as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon recalls a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ West ring @-@ fight icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comedy of the 1980 &apos;s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main roles - a sc@@ ant Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues were syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are some nice ags to see ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ om Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so much engaged in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was re@@ di@@ ated to a smaller length , could repeatedly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message for the imagined communist audience is , that the Western culture can do everything for the food for a money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong , even with our own younger history and theirs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strike on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart numerous objects were searched , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the age of 25 , 15 accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and have already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the officials questioned large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time of the same time , two people were arrested in Italy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German arrest warran@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the two are probably delivered to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in action , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , over 300 police officers were in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia members were accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the great bet was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the eyes of the investigations , mainly Italian citizens with a relative relation to the Italian Ma@@ fia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defects in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the data , ten million people are registered with a foreign nationality , including 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this report , the data are managed by around 600 foreigners in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the data has not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can considerably slow the revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient human rights , moreover , EU citizens are included who would not have to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , such false assignments led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds , so it is said in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ olds once they arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this paper , it means that BA@@ MF is conducting such proceedings in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the paper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , the state can send it back to the single country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason , the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the reception capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy provided guarantees for the inclusion and accomodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) , however , holds these commitments sufficiently for sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a threat to child welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , with his meanwhile 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood in the meeting of the Municipal Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are designed and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood to strangers , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , corn makers reported from the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the D@@ RK district leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house had led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry counted among the majority don@@ ors and awarded 50 donated blood donations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England is likely to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish , &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision makers voted for 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month , as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its quarterly inflation forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that inflation would continue to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it sign@@ alized that , in the next few years , interest rates would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation forecast by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , which was published one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper finance for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will be available 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tightening of monetary policy &quot; would be required for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scale than markets would expect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the markets currently forecast the first rise in the third quarter of the next year , and another in 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank however emphas@@ ised that increases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would take place gradually . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts adjusted down@@ wards for this year and next year are 1.9 % , and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after these messages , the pound fell to the dollar and the euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars , and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to change will come after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for a rate of interest , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growth is expected to fall by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest inflation forecast provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and marginal escal@@ ation , as the tightening will become even worse before it becomes better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy could not prevent the in@@ comes from the coming years , but she added that wages should be re@@ cover@@ able at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which is offset by a proportion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the lowering of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the Bank &apos;s final ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inflation declined from 2.@@ 9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said this was expected and will be put on again in the coming months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entirely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the recent decline of swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive , as the credi@@ tors want to look lou@@ dly to shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are completed , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a fight against the High Court in N@@ HS , patients will receive access to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken before the sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by healthcare to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was welcomed as &quot; important new intervention &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow people to register and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduced HIV transmission in areas of infection .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means taking enough medications in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such medications can be taken every day , or so already two hours before sexual intercourse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in clinics , suitable participants identify who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the program is signed by £ 10 million , and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used and implemented on a large scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in overcoming one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ p , as directed specifically to vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded effort to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority is now to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and obsol@@ ete after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected , and that we will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank woman with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design , that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the generous ceiling height optimal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the pre@@ text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were st@@ acked on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this arrangement enabled him to place two rooms at full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it work longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the kitchen , the reflection looks like a window into another room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went into it , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that when you push the door high , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor surface and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which help to create an emotional bond within a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do not love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter number of somewhat standard , to something quite amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brothers , fighting for a 500 million US dollar real estate empire &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation occurs in the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , the West@@ co jeans founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail outlets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul , described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court file says that this means that Col@@ in owns $ 3@@ 16 million , and Paul &apos;s worth of 17@@ 6 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those proposed by Col@@ in have left him behind what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last Friday , after several failed attempts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has ruled out him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in argued that this is not true , but Paul proposes to manage some possessions in a competent manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an early affir@@ m@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , hoping to settle the dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C and held by both sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the family &apos;s first shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in says that he started in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before the court , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of her financial division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in kept himself very back , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of television stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contact Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul chose to su@@ e me and pull our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he was still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ umps of new Chief of Staff are planning to restrict the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others have tried and failed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe , John F. Kel@@ ly can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the boss on a regular course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House met with senior employees , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kel@@ ly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kell@@ ys Diag@@ nosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media diet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politi@@ co Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps Twitter habit is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps these Campa@@ ig@@ ans know what we do not know , that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have included more combus@@ tible material without their intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the tr@@ ump has not sent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if his employees have managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , no one has consistently prevented dr@@ ump controversi@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which is composed of competing parties , will repeatedly attempt to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Politi@@ co - very busy with this story , reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to bring doubts to the president for strategic reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was an example described by Repor@@ ters Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he is hiding from where they originate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the internet pro@@ voc@@ ate Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief officer K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a bunch of le@@ aks in the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ane or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has vo@@ iced false alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article , and began asking employees about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kel@@ ly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective as pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on dangerous criminals , the police throughout Europe are sent to dangerous criminals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the addresses of the sought @-@ after s@@ word@@ cr@@ aters are not known naturally , notes from the population will be raised and asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported from the action taking place on the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the experience showed that many fle@@ et@@ ers hide themselves from destinations , called Euro@@ pol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have put together 21 postcards for criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 of the online lawyers could not be arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of notices after publication on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Travel@@ ers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are once again faced with some determined trav@@ eller on the foot of war , which have tra@@ ded a land drawn from the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their mansion houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a well @-@ off road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of vans after they were thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section , which remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless is to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am , since he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long teachings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local charge if the Council cannot stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a local people who did not want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last lap of this travel@@ er just to be lo@@ oted from another lap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time , and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an in@@ fu@@ elled camp on the other side of the street brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible to report anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by invo@@ king 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof at Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on March 1 , next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are good news for the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then atmosphere operating company lt@@ d. on 13 April 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building offered the District Council as a collection accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan , in order to secure the area as a hotel location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious potential buyers to the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object , the group has four houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building a building container before the entrance , and when entering the house it becomes clear what major renovation works are done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings are broken down , old bath tu@@ bs were removed from the rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until March , there is still much to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when investment is high , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to precisely define himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just under a million euros , he expects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the external installations are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ aires : us Special En@@ ter sets Grand Jury
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Russian affair by U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller shall have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the board received the work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal on appeal to people familiar with the issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller was wi@@ dened , and intensified its investigations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transmitter CN@@ N reported , that there are already the first invitations from the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ umps of oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time in deliberately interfer@@ ing with the 2016 presidential election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mu@@ eller investigated , if there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump election team and Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to be active in the election campaign as advis@@ er to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also magni@@ fied more and more tr@@ umps in private and business environments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump personally moved into the center and investigate the accus@@ ation that the President may have disabled the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible crime cases , and to decide whether it should be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand uries are therefore also referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mostly , they are switched on when dealing with larger and controversial cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the panel can be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to take action under oath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the CN@@ N , invitations were already issued which revol@@ ve around Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and Russian lawyer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to a statement , called it in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also tr@@ umps counsel@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his former election director Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the translation show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that , if necessary , it should act quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the charging of an accus@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee in the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign for its political opponents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they usually work in secret , he emphas@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a fair manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FBI chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that it was not determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mu@@ eller was first used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this raid , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were loud , he would have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June Com@@ ey asked a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a set of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the investigation , the president is under great pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triggered speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike an independent specialist of Congress such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair of the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step , however . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented legislative designs on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could not be released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Antar@@ ctic : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been replaced by the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research , Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the col@@ os@@ sus , which is heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest ice @-@ gi@@ ants registered in the past three decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no danger for people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extent to which climate change has played a role in the fall of the ic@@ e@@ berg , is unclear according to research data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , for about 30 years now , there has been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of ice el@@ ves in the region , writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to many researchers , this can be related to global warming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the col@@ os@@ sus broken off has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks down regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is located south of South America , almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt was dis@@ rupted a few years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a complete cow@@ ard@@ stick is falling there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot to say that even the Lar@@ sen @-@ C shelf is in danger , as the front edge has never pulled back as far as currently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ice plate stands under tension and can fall apart , if at a key point a piece collap@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as they float on the water and have pushed ice as much water as it produces after melting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the loss of the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this could possibly increase sea level , albeit only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth biggest hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e of Antar@@ cti@@ ca after A@@ WI information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , it breaks down regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural happening and we have no direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest retreat since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among scientists is controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C cow@@ ard@@ s@@ man will continue to grow back or fall back in the long term , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if these explor@@ ers do not lead the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , so many ice cre@@ sts of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have crum@@ bled over the past few decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decline in temperature rose greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has heated around three degrees and thus counters to the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CD@@ U wants a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate at the staff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs were added in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and officials work for the administrative administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teachers at the circle are apparently very much sought @-@ after .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the seats , which were to be held this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places at M@@ ett@@ mann County . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG , and to face the shortage of skilled workers in the administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the shortage of candidates in a future @-@ oriented manner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , to show specific measures for newcom@@ ers and involve a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one did not know earlier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum time for action , so that no more places will remain un@@ occupied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had long ago provided a big surprise for a big surprise when he publicly questioned the personnel costs , and the other parties astonished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be examined that enable a withdrawal from the municipal employer association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the trade unions - maybe in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - should seek a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; says peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually fores@@ ees the tariff for the public service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sal@@ aries are currently prescribed exactly , increases or more money is only when one changes to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes protection law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone on NGO migrants lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned that NGOs operating life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis alert came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had effectively worked together with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relief organisation , which was in operation only for one year , refused to express himself to a detailed alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that we are not able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can assess all accus@@ ations which are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that its crew receives din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered directly from human traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s acts , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crew is suspected of taking away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have an Italian police officer on board , who monitors their activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only three of the nine NGOs , who are involved in search and rescue missions , have previously agreed to abide by the Code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable since they would not bring &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asc@@ ents and tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Northern Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , three friendly guides were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accommodation at the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est von Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in between there were always long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim went to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again , look@@ out points to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; f@@ lown &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bad Dür@@ kop@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breathing a healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 meters , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ru@@ sts itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and weather ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also been recognized by the first federal clubs , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg started in 2015 , later followed by the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many clubs going on this turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers compete in different clubs against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alongside Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen will now advise on a virtual football player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , it is possible to be present online much more often in these markets than to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia once a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will compete in competition level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ gen was well established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the Asian Games of Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but is it a real sport , anyway ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many , the performance is certainly habit@@ ual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber , too , has long been dealing with the question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and rapid response . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise and pay attention to the diet not only on the console , but also to their bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , rob@@ bery sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; controls are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players are on the move internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural im@@ pedi@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , over 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three years , sales should be 130 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , this is little about 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Europe , too , a lot is happening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are committed to setting up an e @-@ sport department . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany la@@ gs behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Executive Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to exp@@ ire only in nostal@@ gia , and to clarify the old times , is no longer sufficient today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digital@@ ised world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t remember that only football remains as it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tox@@ in eggs , E@@ gg alternatives to cooking and baking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ di Süd and Al@@ di Nord have re@@ acted all the eggs from the sale , all over Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regi@@ ments , only eggs should be taken , which are demonstr@@ ably not contained in Fi@@ or@@ pron@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy to commit suicide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted of negligence by Con@@ rad Roy in June , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , folded with folded hands and down @-@ looking eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have changed Con@@ rad Roy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz said he did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or her mental disease have a significant impact on her actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read an explanation of Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not bolt the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything . I try to be there for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to stop another , commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed text messages , that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , hop from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; everything you need to do is turn the generator off and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ju@@ dge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter was looking for Roy &apos;s death , and ordered that she should benefit from any press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the few convic@@ ted Car@@ ters was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted of murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy in 2007 , before being acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Joshua Kim@@ me was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup , is not a coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in FC Bayern , the Con@@ fed Cup winner takes a great season - extra motivation does not hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kim@@ me instantly saw , even if the extra piece was very small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups there was no Philipp Lah@@ m , and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as Bavaria captain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs SS@@ C Naples . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Kim@@ me could also interpret the character from the coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen as a game guide in the C @-@ El@@ f &apos;s youth players , who had just been chosen as a game guide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sugar is best distributed to those who want to get a lot of trust , which you want to keep in mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have been chosen to do the heir of Lah@@ ore , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old came across the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and at all Kim@@ me was working in this starting formation , like the one who can best take the helm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ well @-@ played trou@@ pe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had a look for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ idal &apos;s attempt to over@@ play his missing fitness , Ren@@ ato San@@ ches , on the Devil come to the performance of Asia &apos;s journey , and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not have a negative impact on their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sü@@ ver ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both agile and confident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nam@@ ically occupied Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and addi@@ ct addi@@ ct addi@@ ct to the game building a few times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he also showed a decent performance during his debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; I was also fet@@ ched for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as usual this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one could see the game following the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but rather six or seven interviews . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim@@ me said goodbye to a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements in his new fellow player &apos;s back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of sw@@ an an interesting sentence : &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B La@@ dies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our female F@@ B La@@ dies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Austria &apos;s most well @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has briefly reported on Twitter , and the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies wish all the best . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire is a club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Captain Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck , and be@@ fie@@ bert with our Lad@@ ys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football team of the year and champi@@ ons League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational sy@@ ringe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the famous Bayern @-@ D@@ us@@ el , our ladies might need well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom pace
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is evident after more than a year , in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V enquiry from a change in economic policy - and at the same time add the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke have all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and A@@ den@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 is expected to be the right to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West Bank of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to take the route in operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nat@@ us sees it as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier pursu@@ es a Rheinland @-@ Pf@@ alz @-@ Label , as inspired by Wis@@ sing , in order to boost sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports that have been sag@@ ging for ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber is pra@@ ising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for graduates within ten years of their master education , a premium of 1000 euros is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned road building quickly facts facts , at the same time it fails the country at the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce also calls for more orders to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf &apos;s CD@@ U faction , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to calculations by the Audi@@ tor , the country invested more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 less than suggested country roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Frank nat@@ us still expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the previous broadband expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , regional companies only assessed the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3,@@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stock@@ holding internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ business minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green fraction left Lem@@ ke to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Audi is expected to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software into more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW President said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving limitations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs for autom@@ akers , to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases from diesel vehicles are also increasing , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of forgetting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the companies try to avoid the faults of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices to comply with regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several employees of Volkswagen were accused in the United States , while others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , the former head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to court in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to deal with emissions legislation in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer over@@ looks the win of Volkswagen , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this message has the raft on Saturday , on the Is@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the Is@@ ar Vis@@ itors to participate , a raft around Munich takes a special message on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you go to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the building of the building , wants to clear up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the raft , one sees a large Inf@@ otran@@ s@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a resp@@ ectable ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last summer , the raft sailed across the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los , rab@@ ies and the laughter of suffering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was temporarily one of the most widely published carto@@ ons , the ni@@ enn@@ es of his characters are his trademark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on August 4 , 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first years as an artist , he acted as a dra@@ fts@@ man for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to the end of the 60 &apos;s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines all around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the table today , working almost ten hours a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his dro@@ ll figures continues to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ ander as a counterpart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , his figures speak in 3D film , which will come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change from Provence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is due to drought @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and due to the diseases causing bugs , which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , have prepared great head@@ aches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this has effects on the life span of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small ch@@ ic@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ cal@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the solutions that are considered are better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1,@@ 200 year anniversary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Saturday and Sunday , Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ ep@@ point is a medieval festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cranes , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ ants or a land@@ fall camp are to be experienced in the city centre these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the assassination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce usually meet in Wednesday to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through the organised crime of corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two high @-@ level journalists will discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 or leave them at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security experts have written three words on a plaque on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column , no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who are making the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 , there were at least seven dead in seven states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the latter are the editors and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical pan@@ amas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop takes less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although a special At@@ tor@@ ney General was established in 2010 to treat the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a even though they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is still more tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without information about the murder@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he managed to drive a few blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times were fired on him presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sho@@ oter drove away in his car , and damaged it nearby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ol@@ eums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , is breaking the blame for his friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this release may upset the children , suspected gang@@ sters bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted , that he would always be there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over time , the paper earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ looking investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he gave up voluntarily , that he was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to live on , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J distinction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you see as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ri@@ o@@ odo@@ sius team measures Val@@ dez , the spaw@@ n bird , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his death too forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it smells wrong@@ ly , stay away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce Andr@@ es Vil@@ lar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold solely to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were commissioned by the Land government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce in a four @-@ stor@@ e@@ yed building , in a middle class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen that the Gover@@ nor himself described as un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months ago since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce has b@@ anded on three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of former well @-@ known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also had an exposure to the government spending , concentrated on the town &apos;s hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there was a group located in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so beware when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealers and authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a re@@ porter heard from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled nearly the whole century all the political levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vil@@ lar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one where a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped from military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a few months before , the readers had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of ab@@ duction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; said Vil@@ lar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez rub@@ bed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after the death of Val@@ dez , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez moved away to Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez charged the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , she has been asked to be again divided by the government because she is worried that her anger has hurt her objec@@ tivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also by the command of politicians and security forces who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media coverage group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a computer keyboard and headphones , besides their separate head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach , March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others continue to do what El Man@@ ana did in Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo , after the assassination of its director in 2004 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z addressed the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists fled from their home countries , or even from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a painful decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa , who was assass@@ inated in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , gives the drug dealer al@@ armed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell and therefore I was re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to hum@@ ming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the edge of the ker@@ bs , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir@@ ens how@@ l nearby , another shooting in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch , to see if they were in readiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were afraid , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ci@@ ce followed his mark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day Ja@@ vier asked me to send her for reporting to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue if a frigh@@ tening one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , researchers have discovered that the first insights of the incredible N@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was so well received that they could even determine that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report in Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; Current Bi@@ ology , &quot; described it as &quot; the preserved din@@ osau@@ r that was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Fossi@@ l is a newly discovered type of din@@ osau@@ r living in the middle of the circle , between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved condition , researchers , who describe it as &quot; really worthy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ wn Funk found it when he died on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock out of the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ sh@@ ell Museum where the creature is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or , resembles a shifting arm@@ or , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter@@ act that is also used by many modern animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would have allowed themselves to mix better into his surroundings and to avoid his enemies , say experts , indicating that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ osau@@ rs has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to carefully uncover it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they discovered the lock@@ out , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs due to car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable as loo@@ t , which signals that this natur@@ al@@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on information about his life , including his fourth performer , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the se@@ abed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ osau@@ r is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early cycle time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little with the eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in northern Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , backed by his shoulders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was swept through the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the hood still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured boards along the din@@ osau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in Lot@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more I approach it , the more confusing it becomes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied remnants of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates , which carry the skull of the animal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 cars are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous injured , kilometres long jams and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late afternoon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the first data from the police , between the junction station Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , nearly 30 vehicles , including trucks , were cl@@ amped together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was easy to moderate injury , said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the accident site , a large number of emergency vehicles was charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the direction of travel in Munich , there was around ten kilometres long back @-@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an A@@ Z journalist reports , there was also a massive disability in the opposite way - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade became the hall@@ mark of the vehicle &apos;s handle@@ bars , which now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : no clu@@ e , you sit in the train and sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or one deep@@ ens in his work , and has just a brilliant idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then : buffer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conductor comes and w@@ akes up an uns@@ af@@ e , or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
Deutsche Bahn currently tests the free ticket inspec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you simply confirm by mobile phone , that you take your seat and val@@ ori@@ zes the ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a trial operation runs on two routes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depends on the offer , we extend it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be available for many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; said a train speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the track without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you have to book an online ticket , which anyway most passengers do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB Navig@@ ator app via the app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you climb into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the test customers , a button for the electronic evaluation will be published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the train companions get a message on their mobile devices , that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when travelling card control arrives at square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , check in the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Cor@@ respon@@ dence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the greatest occasions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of@@ ten@@ times , however , one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents required to de@@ grade online tickets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either the credit card or the identity card or a document , which you have to show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , leading to bad spirits in the section or large room and delays in controlling your own tickets and taking the time to take care of other matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can still use the new service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
additional numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken up to its core . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis was born on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confused as nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ra@@ pper of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street , and would stay four hours there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Ferr@@ ell thought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she dropped her mobile phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and of a man claiming to be Brow@@ ns &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she observed a live feed , with which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , shocked another polic@@ eman his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... Anim@@ als all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not usual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Ferr@@ ell remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have gotten used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after landing at 11 o &apos;clock , she picked up her father &apos;s 6 year old daughter and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened in the following three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from the 11th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a story of survival and protest , of love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a Ferr@@ ell with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 year old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must know it , and see it and be raised in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though I am fortunate enough to give her an experience where she is personally experiencing no blat@@ ant racism , she is no different than the next black women &apos;s child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep them away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they prepared pockets , and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slowly , a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating fair@@ ness and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeks later , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came from Ferr@@ ell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people , in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the former Co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ ct in@@ mates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his engagement made Ferr@@ ell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after his shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah Leader , but a community that is coming together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life as they fall in love and marry their wife . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Ferr@@ ell said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the humanity of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teenagers Tra@@ y@@ von Martin , have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; and we are constantly struggling on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ al type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Ferr@@ ell was chosen as the heart of the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sha@@ ved this energy , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no accident , although it was on the front line because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial ties between the congregation and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years , because of blocking a highway at a demonstration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels oblig@@ ated to remember this memory since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bit gallery moves the people , even though they are not built for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while they say one to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , the rest of the shops also benefit from the fact that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition : the gallery is planned precisely on the plot , on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the beginning of the construction work , this will be the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility of sitting outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping almost weekly in the farmers market for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women &apos;s women always love again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we would wish that during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other cities , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing can settle in a market hall in the gallery will come to the level of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project is unlikely to be low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg for ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of this , there is already enough in our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can see , how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is also inexpensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are only rented by larger firms , because the rent is often not portable to a retailer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pity , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wolf F@@ andel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , where is the farmer &apos;s market hall going ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or does it create the ghost bit gallery before , to drive all the shops in Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that won &apos;t work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a shopping centre that is empty , nobody needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - useless building projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place any place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall gets broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown ones that are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen a@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ ave worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison term after she publicly posted diplomatic messages on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new exhibition opened on August 2 , called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline has united her specialist expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ member and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent who had only three days in his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look like somebody with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and created the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , has been convic@@ ted of identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations of the Act of es@@ pion@@ age , computer fraud and theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the prison , their image was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is clearly located on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in it , the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette sil@@ encing and chew@@ ing gum , by extrac@@ ting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was the time she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist and her detained m@@ use were too un@@ equal , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they even created a comic &quot; supple@@ mental image &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president would judge the Over@@ seas verdict and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that Obama really would ask only a few days after the book was published to ask Mann@@ ing Release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome sort of happy meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways that he should actually fix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing with her super@@ big signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is equipped with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific lex@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what people hopefully will take with you is that our gen@@ ome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so it is 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ novel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a free @-@ talk @-@ phone in the hands of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they chill out your speech , then they have won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it should be anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ors that cl@@ ash like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was also purpos@@ eful , as all in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing stat@@ ure ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor of University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University , for killing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who was looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on July 27 , 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the scene of the event , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , La@@ a has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ o had now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokesman of the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked , and wanted him to be himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building which had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was confirmed by security cameras , that La@@ o and War@@ ren were in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian Vice @-@ Secretary Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented to restore the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Dis@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ introduction of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to M@@ ko , he has nothing to concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced and everything is being implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the state @-@ funded dop@@ ing approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has got an error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talking to the Russian sales office at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov took problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody asked to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ nov added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA in the wake of dop@@ ing control in Russia as part of the dop@@ ing scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di sold no eggs for the time being
these were shared by the company groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , and no health impairment could be assumed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from now on , only eggs can be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ pro@@ verb@@ s anti @-@ L@@ umin@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di wanted to produce clarity and transparency with his customers .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure happiness with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out , how their employees feel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it makes it possible to address surveys , specialists groups and complaints hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the snap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can drill down why . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture , a former employee has published a blog post , which describes a environment of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken have been punished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry may have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the finance engineering site let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ e in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , more than a client has registered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent will send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has seized the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a company is found that does not treat its employees or behave eth@@ ically , costly consequences can be experienced by consumers boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track complaints from employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations through the En@@ ron scandal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service , and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , who supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies like S@@ apphire V@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and earned his total funding to $ 60 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising considering the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than ever from their jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated , and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work that you do is worthwhile , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In who uses both Con@@ ver@@ sible and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors can reach returns if their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to experts from workplace culture , the data on employee engagement is important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the data are useless if the managers of a company take no action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , if a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if the change is not fast enough or not at all , this can motiv@@ ate disappointment and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company too much for collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you are not going to follow people , ask &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you worry about that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys has been able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem about G@@ LIN@@ T is reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated staff , she was able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long term this leads to better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose customers , then you will lose business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA footage players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have pulled out their tri@@ cot parts , and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise , before returning next morning at 6 : 30 to the Water@@ man Football Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day after the break was postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 prior to the beginning of the formal preparations for the start against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said he supports the rule of rule of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the many busy routes of the player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it is very challenging . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they were plac@@ arding , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp ends , which is thrown out of an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel belonging to the elevated park behind a gate post , which will not be an easy task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s a real problem , and it &apos;s not far to think that people rent a room and then choose to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking place 8 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , I don &apos;t worry too much about this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts review in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false noti@@ fications to third parties and display their results under the original contribution then said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual checks that may be displaying results of the fac@@ tual test from the original article .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Facebook announced in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; in connection &quot; article , and working on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cosy seat in Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des and a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says bol@@ dly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every story was illustrated by another , forthcoming bri@@ tish artist , Bri@@ ony May Smith , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : it wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; - a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , which worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and letters sm@@ elling with smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he was himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who is struck with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome speech &quot; ) it all seems too nice to be true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ olith@@ ic pots on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landscape fountain , gardening and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night , he drank a whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to care about the archive which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ aries , letters from the period of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting two families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let &apos;s all go ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to pl@@ unge on a broader base into English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Pe@@ as@@ ant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol which the family Dar@@ r@@ ell hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell was portrayed in the 18th century that filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed quite gau@@ dy to always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se Er@@ r@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ vil@@ coats , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the revelation of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for the launch of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of August , there should be a festival highlight on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ ver@@ th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the posters on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and to make it clear , some things are better than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a mid @-@ five @-@ digit amount , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost their new umbrella brand and campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises about reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so also this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first glance , a normal process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nothing is routine in Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting did not take place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the five vice @-@ ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the meetings under the chair@@ manship of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the civilians in Y@@ AS were in number . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the military , the government pus@@ hes the re@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the failed coup , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 10.000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who were directly involved in the coup attempt , this week , Ankara is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; since he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; uncomfortable in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban for soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the metrop@@ olitan coach of the army and the security forces continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by a decree of further 7@@ 3@@ 95 occup@@ ants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier , gener@@ als were considered to be the actual lords of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , they appealed to their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former officers say , Erdo@@ gan is driving a target of Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , seeking asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is true , NATO could not let Nato go cold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , in the Alliance for the pur@@ ges there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter regulations for granting vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and cut billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by modi@@ fying the way people from other countries of green cards are spent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to track track for racing platform shuttle
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , the racing platform has been cont@@ ested over the past few months - now it &apos;s supposed to be very fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the end of the year , at the end of the year the tour is to be built on which the tourist train is driving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to secure the future of the racing platform sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the route should begin again this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the circuit Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this particularly important link , &quot; declared Transport State Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 2.5 million euros , the cost of servicing the route paid off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this sum , the country receives 75 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contract , on which the shuttle should also be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operators , have already agreed on technical details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of 11 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shuttle service should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the racing platform shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g , particularly among tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the range is used by a sufficient number of people to order regular orders in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the track is in parts highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as you thought that 2017 may not be cra@@ zier , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor for Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm , with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the user can also customize his robot according to his convi@@ ctions , and select anything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah . &quot; that conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the day , she also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive feminine features that go to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ance ) Far@@ rah is dis@@ concer@@ ting one the most .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy uses a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their rising popularity , they still remain on the edge of consumption culture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what emerges from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market gives them permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots emerge in a time where the rights of women are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most sc@@ ary aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos; T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images that eng@@ ul@@ fs the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the stoch@@ astic eyes but how real@@ istically this vision works .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cannot separate themselves from their companion , or simply go away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have no mediation or a background story , nothing that could interfere with independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , they are fake slaves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
or to put it in the phrase of 2017 : maid
pumps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a syn@@ ch of tr@@ ump @-@ era , that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have also split families in small format . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of addic@@ ting relatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all strive to make our filter bags burst , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less noticed has been the power of tr@@ umps , families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House anyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it falls to me in another context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the immediate effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more horri@@ fic long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans of the Right wing , which suddenly appear to be the ep@@ it@@ ome of skill in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I think of an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ onic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump occurrence happen to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump dies , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cre@@ ed and the animals twist in order to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ ffy music communic@@ ates this in a curious way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city won &apos;t meet the dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ five years later and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed no Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 year old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and have a great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I could have been able to rate the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , during this week I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , he was taken to hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , which he had suffered in his cell after a case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first dead end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , throwing them through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , which they say they are too cautious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Law Office said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us risks that his sentence will be increased to 15 years , when the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Bauer Arnold finds a remarkable egg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ door pupils were dischar@@ ged from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen during the holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , three of the students go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening , school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chosen a young eagle , who grew up in the h@@ ens , but then released into freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band has a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the chicken farm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to breed with his chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of it sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , the cylinders were carrying the bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said school manager Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the young animal is different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted every four @-@ door sler , that he feels accepted in his new school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there followed thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps to lower @-@ level pas@@ sports and the parents representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two years of teaching , she was very reluct@@ ant to leave school because it had been a really great time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door hat@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
eight first @-@ grade students are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camps in Greece , refer@@ enced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , refer@@ enced by TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day , they were released , while a study is underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greek authorities have ag@@ grav@@ ated control of the free camp and lay down to anyone who is found to stay in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the whole season , the controls will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry said , that the court could impose a fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of some 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro @-@ 4 diesel , or worse , are excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates only apply to the vehicles that Schum@@ ann software has , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting , the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next few months , but has not yet been named an exact date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler advised everyone to write to each person concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in the context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will the conver@@ sions be , in general ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers , as well as from political pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for we have seen , voluntarily the deal@@ er@@ ships do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long will the update last ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the workshop , the conversion itself could take only three to four hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what do drivers do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advises you to wait .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would re@@ ap , so S@@ met@@ e@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy &apos;s award gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the lau@@ re@@ ates doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first ra@@ pper , ll Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the awards ceremony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced that participation in the gala has been neglected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to escape - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized , she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify their point of view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kennedy &apos;s Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we make the city life worth
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs City Engineer , will reti@@ re next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the job is already written out , but suitable candidates are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker City Engineer has been a town builder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the work still makes him a lot of fun , as he communic@@ ates in the press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells of varied but demanding tasks , waiting for his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , it is surprising that no application has yet to fulfil the requirement profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the earliest possible point , the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there is still plenty of time to work under consideration of the regular termination of notice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Has@@ lach works for the Administr@@ ative Association as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must inform the applicant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this function , the city wants to keep in any case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this could not be fulfilled , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the proximity to the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker , who speaks of a good company climate as well as good mood among the authorities and citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated to look back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building and his staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Low @-@ plane parking place are initiated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kin@@ zig @-@ Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will hit a volume of about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of design , there is a large room for urban planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , it is possible to react quite flexibly to many . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the old part of the old town is listed as an ensemble , it is important to have an eye on what it fits , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city building master stresses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a great responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of co @-@ operation : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also that his successor stays for a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bike on lines thrown : south railway line blocked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike from the railway track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetrators , and have been looking for them since the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; near the scene of the crime , a sco@@ oter and a bike driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a Lus@@ ati@@ a kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator , or the perpetr@@ ator , had brought himself into great danger and threatened the train traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay and the costs for rail traffic , P@@ ön@@ als of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , to go out of a &quot; substantial &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway line could be guided without obstruc@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barely ten people were left on Friday morning , two of them went to the correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freight trains did not fall , but they had delay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
isol@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han help to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna said , that immune cells in the intest@@ ines pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cells that are able to cause inflammation , are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in experiments , it has been established that a type of tolerance promoting immune cells occurs in mice that carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han , one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet tolerant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also affects people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post@@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell supporting the tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same trunk , which was separate but not had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mice were sequ@@ enced in the mice and found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i left in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism which is known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Manchester United , having signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his dé@@ but against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira pre @-@ mar@@ ched at will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve prior to the Premier League season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent recently revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pilots flew away from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the radar screens , the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Boeing had previously done such advertising , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing @-@ logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new deep@@ throat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the wind rot@@ ates : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister still looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; merely no distur@@ b@@ ance from the party centre , but not a bac@@ kl@@ ash from the federal government - this was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , it has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Schulz from there has been from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach by the head@@ wind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was ra@@ inf@@ all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one by one , one after another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition between the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows once again : red @-@ Green can simply not be trusted , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five months before the election of the State Parliament , the red @-@ green coalition lost their one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Green Party executive , Michael Kell@@ ner , asked El@@ ke T@@ jackets to give back their mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear for@@ gery of the voting power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and Leader of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter gro@@ ans , as on Friday afternoon the new job of the party has reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is following the transition from the green de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U without their own government majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the misery began with the unexpectedly sharp defeat at the Saar@@ land election , in March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a blue eye , no more , the Com@@ ra@@ de paci@@ fied himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the case , and everything became much worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the w@@ ob@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te pushed the party smoothly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the weeks afterwards , comrades shou@@ ted again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , when they had just sli@@ pped new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with him , the next deep@@ throat came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and because in crisis communications after that , everything was wrong about what to do wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ liers and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
average survey data were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , or perhaps this is why , in the past few weeks , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the covenant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aspir@@ ation of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they left him , because they promised to stabil@@ ise the party by Wei@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the im@@ parti@@ ality of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and Martin did not at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the present time , the comrades are trying to keep their ranks closed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the reb@@ elled parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ ests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democr@@ atis@@ fying how Mrs. T@@ ests puts her own career entran@@ ts over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ ests has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but by the national list of the Lower Saxon Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony member continues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters for four years ago were clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to know if there was more or more commitments made by the CD@@ U , Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
grants for local people III
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would like to rehabil@@ itate his house in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives attended town development on Wednesday in emotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review of what happened so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1991 , there have been extensive rehabilitation areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the renov@@ ations have been a &quot; success project . &quot; finally , it is important to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new building areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe , that there will be a restructuring area III . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total amount of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros would come from the country , the rest from the community . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how is a renovation area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue to investigate so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it also plays a role in renov@@ ating it in the planned area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if necessary , the area borders may be moved again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ country program &quot; Social City , &quot; where the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the remedi@@ ation area would then be defined as a statute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grant period for the grant proceeds from January 1 , 2017 , until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , until September this year the survey would only be carried out in the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire for filling out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in November or December , the statute will be set as possible , so that the renov@@ ations will begin next year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann concluded that every commun@@ e had to carry out the said pre @-@ examination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a question of assessing and deciding when san@@ iti@@ sed , and to what extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for each plot , it is also recorded in the basic book . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to the senses and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and development arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which it is concerned with the structural condition and the renovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on the size , distribution and residents of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when operating in the building &apos;s premises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of funds after the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t reserve funds for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Location &quot; II &quot; were shown to make the audience a &quot; tasty &quot; experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip , in order to get to the house and car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consultant in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is executed according to the medical standard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip , and lasts only 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the lock of houses and cars , so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per ch@@ ateau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the married father of one has now built in both home and his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military provided by the TI@@ ME magazine , up to $ 24.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is aboard , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a helicopter from Ma@@ ine , a truck from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , was produced in Connec@@ ti@@ cut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo of barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn according to the records of the helicopter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) and the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and so long remained until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the restriction of the service hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit stayed on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the records provided by the TI@@ ME , it did not clear out whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal states to use national property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could violate the destiny .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was declared an official event by the White House , and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential jet performed in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages describing the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is excited about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , which are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy president of the White House Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn , in order to set up the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event lasted for the month of training , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours on that day for non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokesman for S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps , Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for the estim@@ ation rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , the former president of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things made in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky &apos;s representative and talked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
the Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis League join the S@@ V in the ranking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow , the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss res@@ ig@@ ns at 11 : 00 p.m. in Kiel at the S@@ V . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite five games still spot@@ less , the Le@@ aders of the Second Tennis League have received the sense of reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the post@@ erior positions , I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , imports from the high North provide for class and stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ ba ( all Denmark ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec active Fren@@ ch@@ man , Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) wins the tournament in this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the White Russians An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was to be at Kiel as well as bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his two victories in the past Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also back to the team again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill someone out of the Train@@ erst@@ ab around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how America can damage O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really happy was Donald Tr@@ ump , when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packaged a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was har@@ assed by the US advance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , investors from the local O@@ MV , which together with other European firms , have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian East Service Nord Stream 2 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , it is too early for estim@@ ating the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump should even bring the sanctions to life by executive order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has seen what the group could defend and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is cent@@ red in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer has revealed the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not passed yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and presented the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as a Fort@@ une 500 company with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( San Francisco Denis ) , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

role back : the city provides 46 dishes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again , again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with fixed contact partners for the children , and an assignment to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the city &apos;s day care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of September 1 , the city Kre@@ feld will take over the provision of food in the city &apos;s day care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , assistant director in the field of youth welfare , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooking is still out of the house , a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers freshly cooked ch@@ illed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 child@@ care centers , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last kit@@ ten year 2@@ 800 children each sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , not only children who are taken care of 45 weekly hours in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita for lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour care if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September . they pre@@ heat the food delivered , add salad , raw food and fruits , divide meals , clean off , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the size - there are two groups , as well as seven @-@ section units - decide on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for that reason , it is also about : healthy eating and cooking lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical solution for the city as the most economical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this , although 46 part time forces are re@@ configured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong in the educational sector , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three women candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credible , if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afghan elections for the provincial council , and the presidential elections take place on April 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the elections for the first time will put the power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said , a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Afghan independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by registered 3,@@ 6 million voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hiking tour to the TV anniversary
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the occasion of the 110 year anniversary , the TV Kaiser@@ ingen invites you to a small hike with a coffee and cake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hike starts on Sunday , July 9th , at 1@@ pm in Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten in the water reservoir in the American sauce . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from there it goes to the airport , to Nat@@ ter and over the Wald@@ hof back to the reservoir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hike takes about one and a half hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , there will be coffee , cake , cool drinks , Sa@@ iten@@ stran@@ gest and Che@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who needs a lift from Kaiser@@ ingen to Froh@@ n@@ st@@ etten , Germany : meeting point is in Kaiser@@ ingen at the school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police information , the men spoke to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who sat down with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 14.@@ 55 a.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request , but continued with her friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , one of the perpetrators tried to grab the cell phone and the necklace of the girl , which however failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without a prey , the duo fled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , the two young men were arrested by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations are running .
G@@ MB concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , a union would like to see the long @-@ term commitment to production in its Glasgow plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said G@@ MB Scotland , the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which in addition to other products , Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner , Pla@@ i said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experienced first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines would not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers focus strongly on local community and large @-@ scale Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of pla@@ ques said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we estimate the continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uns@@ af@@ e business climate , we regularly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in lines of production and operating improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and completely . if our operations change at the location , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
La League &apos;s side may regret her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar Paris , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not rel@@ inqu@@ ish it after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to dis@@ regard its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Day ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid pro athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers sal@@ aries of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a spring has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , three years ago , the football world was warned of the PS@@ G President against this prospect ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strong warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players within themselves , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not permit the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator has deliberately thrown off a sco@@ oter in the Royal Fiel@@ ds street in front of the estate number 30 , causing damage from over 200 Euro to the cl@@ adding of the vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for notices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police seek witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because a car was arriving on its lane , the driver had to leave a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the control plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um arrived on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the location of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car arrived on his track , so he had to turn right to the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the console . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on passenger cars , property damage was created . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driver of the coming car , a Mercedes Benz , had hau@@ led a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the accident , it can be good that the Mercedes driver didn &apos;t even notice the accident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police therefore asks for witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the responsible vehicle , to contact the com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at 05@@ 7@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse incidents reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues for discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ es , spokesman for the reform@@ ist movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after publication of the former Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false assessment of the events at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence in Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it would have to be &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; which would have to be punished and in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people like to go to the church and that is a dev@@ oti@@ onal fres@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; stripes were a completely normal educational tool &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often di@@ ved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memorial book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must take protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the report report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what exactly is in the 440 page report presented by the At@@ tor@@ ney Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment , Ulrich Weber ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high plau@@ sibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who had been active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , many cases of physical and mental violence were applied by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more violent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases combine even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is relieved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against protection of arms in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became tangible to the public when a cathedral spar@@ row didn &apos;t bring top performance musi@@ cally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you assess this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has just been dedicated to eight pages , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the exc@@ esses of the pres@@ ch@@ ool took place outside of his sphere of influence , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can at best disc@@ ard it , experience it too late or have the first indications taken seriously enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ ar gym@@ nasi@@ um , which he worked , was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; as an extremely well @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his great emotion@@ ality , which led to break@@ downs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and put the keys on the ground , but also pinn@@ ed on the hair or ears , he himself admitted already years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the question of time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you know such breeding methods too ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence processes at the pres@@ ch@@ ool are , of course , Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you wonder if it &apos;s not about his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that a lot of media just crashed on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth , however , is : the report rati@@ fies George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , in connection with the report , a lot about the issue of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen has been reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final report , will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged with any involvement or co @-@ ordination with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults , claiming to have confi@@ ded to the master &apos;s master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not even the parents were consec@@ rated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the true problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most victims are silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and sisters , then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen disciple R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely results and could have stopped the respective off@@ ender .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is reck@@ oned to him ... Bu@@ ben im@@ penet@@ r@@ able or clearer or even more open than to their parents , intermedi@@ aries , trust teachers , etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that you talk with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report concludes with the very clear result : &quot; in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their surroundings , he could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to say of any co @-@ ordination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he cannot be accused either of preventing him or being brought to the display . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore there is no reason to link his good name with these contradictory crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violence processes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had to be read in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s former dom@@ ici@@ le master is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this reproach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem in reporting everything mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but exactly this , in turn , is a mis@@ use of the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is , namely , clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence , and , once again , say , other alle@@ gations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the terrible investig@@ ative pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were dra@@ fted and s@@ led , were all suitable at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with them , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys on the face when they were already at the cathedral @-@ spar@@ row gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , as most of the witnesses stated , the subject &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment , and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ eck@@ en@@ gym@@ nasi@@ um ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases combine even positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have st@@ owed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first time 1970 / 71 , when he just started to establish himself and was responsible for a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then back around 1993 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently give ear to the states ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral Choir , which the report was even reproduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this point , he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool I will continue to practice the test . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as test fin@@ es were also banned in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , they occurred in a legal grey zone , as each of us probably knows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was difficult for him to estimate , where those concerned might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one can &apos;t say , he had always looked away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that just isn &apos;t true .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in 1980 , the test punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis said yes , it was unfair to apply today &apos;s educational standards for the time at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging past moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgu@@ sting at all times and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s shri@@ mps , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s all terri@@ fying , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the same time , I must take protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. to draw the ear @-@ neck and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a physical punishment , he was also strictly forbidden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the image of George R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s time in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of Prü@@ fer also come to speech ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about his brother Joseph &apos;s life , i.e. Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , says from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t know by any means that he conducted a stric@@ test regi@@ ment there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bis@@ cuits and candy alone , one does not make a big singer and before any success , regardless of which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the conversations with her book ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deeply believing and heart @-@ good people , of whom one could not imagine that he could do something like a fly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regularly get in touch with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen today , 23 years after his retirement , visit him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today , that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that might be - but also a lovely respect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are teaching methods , which were at the time of the order of the day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can be happy , that we have long since overcome this time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the media sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is the evil intent that is behind it , only too obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there would be a nin@@ ety @-@ year @-@ old man , who had acquired great mer@@ its without ever knowing the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
