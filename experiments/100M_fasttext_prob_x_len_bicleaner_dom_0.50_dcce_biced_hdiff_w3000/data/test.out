28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cor@@ pse , discovered on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , shared the geri@@ atric department in San Francisco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder , and the investigations are running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him sor@@ ely , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokesman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; he shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; joining us with his family was to cook and cook for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the brother , who swa@@ m with the river . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has the information , is asked to call the SF@@ PD below the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has made the Hollywood star so clear in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put into drawers or I get stuck on the outside label that has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather easy to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opol@@ itan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of the TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , says it in the magazine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a white draft , she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; is Ani@@ ston as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film runs with us from August 25th , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger wins the Sports Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for some variation with a ride on the beach with some colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their evening , they were hunting in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the for@@ age comforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with that , the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had his family run over the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even go for photo purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen , as part of a small gala , the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for awards , the like@@ able sports@@ man is not lacking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silver lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the Queen &apos;s Queen has already bl@@ amed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long , the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday , he met the first winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 more outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was included in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t are among the designated riders of Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ tigh@@ ten and the fen@@ cers Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company walked to the Spring@@ stadium where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade agreement T@@ TP , this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential applicants are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the , about the role of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate death , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be completely different , claimed Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will heavily drive on regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has specific tasks to fulfil , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ dless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies , and are strictly denied by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , on tr@@ ump , party discussions could be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants , and to drive coal mining in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , and the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to extend and demand renewable energy with its investment program : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , they don &apos;t want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but just want to better protect American jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be paid even better , says Clinton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ ump , then he says , he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop in the tax policy of the two camps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens , is to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his critics point to him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand Clinton , at least asked by the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fled woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual violence is a part of women who flee alone , almost everyday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a large kitchen , four women sit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each one has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one has put her little son in his arm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with big eyes , he looks curi@@ ously into the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is the division managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and is concerned , among other things , women on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the north of Munich , they live in one of the few de@@ centralized homes for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs organized the establishment with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are no men , either as visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman arriving here has experience sexual violence on her escape , &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted by torture or death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons prevail : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their home they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honorary kill@@ ings , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the run , that goes on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for instance , to demand a bottle of water a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they acc@@ use in Germany , are mistaken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and badly ab@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that about 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ sed , estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not born voluntarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations only need for them , demands B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria , the seven district regi@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich , some answer no . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fle@@ dged women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokesman of the government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some stor@@ eys or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy or will men and women stay together , it can - perpet@@ u@@ ating - violence against women come &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is included in the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women feel this need for protection , can be read at the rush of people who are on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been around for a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
aid doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of the assistance physicians have called their union to approve new combat measures in their disputes relating to a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to approve any more action measures from the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers would have given ministers to deal with concerns about the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , assistance physicians and medical students have agreed on the rejection of a contract negotiated with the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was rejected by 58 % of his members , who voted in the elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members , which was published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have stayed in@@ sist@@ ently &quot; to problems , leading to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to approve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating work for action that begins at the beginning of September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the disputes led to the fact that , this year , assistance physicians introduced six times the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the election , the leader of the BM@@ A assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ igned from the BM@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared BM@@ A members during meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 ophthalm@@ ologists and medical students , that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands , and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish equivalent in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to be sli@@ pp@@ ily and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restrained relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , a newspaper wrote that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved like never before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduction words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moscow &apos;s reaction to time , however , was burning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin divided and accused Ankara , Russia in his back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline was even greater , as it was committed by an alleged friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to rebuild the c@@ ousin is difficult , if not impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media carried out a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has cont@@ ested this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies that he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and foremost , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of his ministry last month in a failed coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti used it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes are long here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ankara is angry with the West , as it regards its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continuing res@@ ent@@ ment over the s@@ nail stamp of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state authorities after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which has a deep fear of regime change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the summit in this splendid palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries , who violate the West and feel bad , and now join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial discussions , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of Turkey deliberately mis@@ placed it on a question about their differences , while Putin chose to emphasize them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no clear consensus on it , where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey ab@@ sc@@ aled the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Executive Committee of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from collap@@ sing and saved almost eight years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer finance brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now , she has decided to focus more on national stamps . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized office and stock exchange to Nat@@ al will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are other smaller brands for private client business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a viewing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as to the brand among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global goals , but to pursue local targets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work with the customers among these brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to develop ourselves to the bank of the brands , as how do we focus internally ( we have asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these stamps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Pre@@ dile@@ ction , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved his 3.@@ 000@@ th prize at New@@ market &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne for a double in New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win in New@@ market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his local race track , he set a milestone on his local race track with his second prize of the night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who before won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened with New@@ market , because I &apos;ve landed here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am relieved , and very modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the jubil@@ ation when he picks up the win at Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ year winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career paths &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that has reached only a few before him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect different from the others in the weight control room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already enjoyed this sport for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and grand@@ tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank@@ ie already got a winner in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race but beyond that , he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he &apos;s not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier , that he wants to continue to compete in competitions up to his age of 5 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Putin sm@@ ash Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff , Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s narrow@@ est confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has ordered Ivan@@ ov@@ s for the resignation of Ivan@@ ov@@ s as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 , Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy , has been appointed his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is written ( in Russian ) that he was later the chief administrator and Chief of Staff of the Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your work as head of state concerning bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post , and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are smiling faces convincing ?
this step has made Moscow secre@@ tive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a long time , Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ ded Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men asser@@ ted that Chief of Staff withdraw@@ s at his own request . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is the consequence of a type of power struggle ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the official asser@@ tion that a man , who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , would once again want to lead Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V commen@@ ced the post in December 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the K@@ GB state security service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he trusted most . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally to Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin became Prime Minister , before he became president three and a half years later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved last month in a physical examination of the set of series in Los Angeles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement its termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the set , there came about artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; details on how the character Gib@@ son follows from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to thank the writers , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were mirr@@ ored by a fountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the $ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cover b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the $ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Economy , Keith Brown , today visited the construction site and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , almost 79 % of the deck decks are at their place and the last section of the deck is a concrete shot for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager at For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this fantastic project , the closure represents forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after installation of the last street cut and its connection with the northern tower in the extension , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the landing page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters to the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a massive , and at the same time very sensitive activity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards of about 3 % upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the toler@@ ances that the team were working towards were tiny , they were only a few milli@@ meters on each side . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rescue at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown by their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station was alert on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of their reach until we left the water , &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a boat hanging without a life@@ jacket . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they all came aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this triggered the boat from the person who headed the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , someone has been watching over these men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seriously injured - man hits his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ stabili@@ zed perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when she came to the apartment , he came to her twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 44 year @-@ old was injured by hand , and in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police could arrest the perpetrators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this then alar@@ ming his sister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , she could not move it to leave the apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her companion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ life partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old gave up his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who builds low @-@ priced apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens think that investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you react to the bad news , that in the next few years Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 budget apartments ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD will propose a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and foremost , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the affordable housing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to build on urban areas , must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions and is still to be financed , is to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U wants to make investors very few rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left wants to remain tough@@ er for investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite this , viol@@ ently , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is van@@ ishing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more staff is needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear , whether we will get the experts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but still the programme is not entirely new : because the around 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but how is the loss of further 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2020 , there will be 500 apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokesperson Nicole Palm now should be purchased from the town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it would have to be thought about buying apartments back into the price relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is possible in the West@@ stadt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in the West@@ stadt , Fri@@ es run out at the end of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing corporations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically elevated , it is removed from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no more concentration of socially weak in just a few parts of the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on , that there will be still movement in the discussion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that teenagers and children go no longer to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time playing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then video games and last on smartphones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don &apos;t exclude each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I am referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in the beginning of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are followed by a GPS and once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a generation that played the game when it was younger , joined the wre@@ ath and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which follows 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post a few days after the launch of the game , the number of people followed each day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , it merely sees the raw data to increase performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns for the health people want to take &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day , because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who regularly drives sport , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people even include new friend@@ ships in the hunt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also m@@ ack@@ y players who have to complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will fade with time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active players in the real world and help many people go hunting to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .

all along the line brilliant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and now , finally , the Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast collap@@ sed and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her total score of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the Swedish beam during the single multi @-@ day competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ ly is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a championship title and , in total , the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment was an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ ly has dominated the last three years , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a disappointment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ day competition of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bil@@ a took the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although accounting existed , during its long journey to the top , never to have planned the future , it is not really true . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which included their typical tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , was trained in Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the summer of 2013 she has lost no more competition , a series of victories that will last as long as it wishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture was clou@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swedish beams and soil str@@ ands - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the ho@@ beam - and replaced with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ra@@ is@@ man im@@ pover@@ ished her as she expected her funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on bright red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her collective book , became reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; O@@ ma , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the exercise of the soil , she turned to the public kis@@ ses , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in serial killer when listening to music in the car
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl were shot who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police told that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ bery , as the att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who owned one of the adult victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police spokesman of Phoenix S@@ gt@@ . Jonathan Howard said that the sho@@ ot@@ ings lead the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at , whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , seven people were killed and two injured in h@@ is@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is thought that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies , a black BMW from the late 199@@ 0@@ ies and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence , which they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , aimed at an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder , and that it was the work of the serial killer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but like the least of his followers , Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I &apos;m not able to do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has settled on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Vincent and her husband have been informed that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize them , and that he may not even survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to walk with a help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ed@@ mund was unable to sit or craw@@ l at the age of his third year , and he still cannot speak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund presents for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please tell me something &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him a sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News told him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented several characters on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the a@@ ic@@ a@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions can vary greatly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say , how it will affect the lives of infected with the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I asked constantly , what will happen ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I haven &apos;t asked for a long time after the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect it to really tell me someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Z@@ ik@@ a@@ virus .
it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you know , that it will become better for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy rain@@ falls , floo@@ ding gives cause to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency , on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi out@@ flood their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rain , reported the national weather service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities , and are already on the way to the affected communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokesman for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness , along with the Gover@@ nor , shared the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , alone , had demanded ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a flood warning system is used across large parts , in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather service announced that , in this area , additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Com@@ is near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely achieve record levels over the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs , near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also said that an up@@ stream floo@@ ding in Ascension par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers flow only slowly into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue teams still ad@@ ored people from the flood water in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly over night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives nearby , warned him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and poured in the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years she lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members would have all disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood was spreading rapidly , because there were still heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and that the authorities should consider ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer was reported near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been significantly reduced since Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and street floo@@ ding triggered the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and a black@@ out in five school districts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ BS subsidiary , WW@@ L reported that a subordin@@ ate in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa 200 flooded houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals , which were flus@@ hed by the floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were established to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water begins to go back , they will return to their homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood , and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents to take the water out of their houses and shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his claims , a handful of houses were reported to have been in@@ und@@ ated on Thursday , but no reported on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , donated by bul@@ lets , survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police agree that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 year old child is shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries , including in the end , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital at his transportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done much , his little body was pun@@ ctu@@ ated by bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital , and he had to undergo several operations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter , that he is expected to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown was one of four people , who were shot in German@@ town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car , with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the other two victims were not in the car , and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ator could be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia , which apparently came to a bon@@ fire between several arch@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ ron@@ age @-@ sleeves for storm @-@ guns , which have been traced to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ se@@ ded the crime scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it seems , that this has been clearly a struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , shells were located . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also made in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ ill on his arm when she played before her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is re@@ covering , and the police are still looking for a suspect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why we need Sim@@ one Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns , and that for more than one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have been in every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and second , this team has three female gym@@ n@@ ast , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jewish and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon , makes everyone proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this team is mirr@@ oring the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last four years , the number one under the female gym@@ n@@ ast was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas celebrated a surprising Olympi@@ ad of Olympic and America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champi@@ onships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gym@@ nasi@@ ums in the whole country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to make it into the olymp@@ ic team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gym@@ n@@ astic teams . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but reality looks like Tur@@ ner is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily in private gym@@ nasi@@ ums that are maintained by parents responsible for training , training , competition and hotel costs ( for coaches and their gym@@ n@@ ast and families ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of these Turn@@ outs lie in wealthy suburbs , who can support the business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner gets its entire training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started doing gymnas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to give the communities au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , make possible an affordable and easily accessible gymnas@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I founded my gym@@ nasi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during my events , we offered free and affordable gymnas@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits to health , as well as for academic and professional success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; thanks to the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
assist doctors want to organise other strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ministers had hoped to stop the dispute over the adoption of a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 Assistance Sur@@ geons who voted for election rejected him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the Treaty and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract , containing changes to night and weekend stays in order to improve the care for un@@ scheduled times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through discussions have strug@@ gled against the government , and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this happened because of a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month , that his door was always open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must now act , lift up the care and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he does not do this , the assistance physicians have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further combat measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in giving cover to doctors on the strike list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers had hoped to be able to stop the dispute over the amendments made by the reform@@ ist Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekly pay for the 5@@ 4,000 ophthalm@@ ologists who are subject to the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , urged the assistance physicians to stop the strike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work combat measures achieve nothing of the only little , but burdens the patient , car@@ ers and their families only worries , need and break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two months , we talked to the Committee of the Assistant Doc@@ tors and had a positive response to the concerns concerning tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional age , were training courses , mutual recognition of the training plan , training holidays and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day &apos;s medication , which can reduce heart attack risk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after it was recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the anti @-@ inflammatory drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction for people with a heart disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , which reduces the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ICE regulatory authority , N@@ ICE , has recommended for a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ICE regulatory authority , N@@ ICE , has recommended for a four year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some 14@@ ,000 people have a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and con@@ j@@ ammed the flow of blood to the brain causing a stroke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca , and marketed under the commercial name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the N@@ ICE line design , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all persons who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a preliminary recommendation by T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness , opens elections in Muslim areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office for corruption from office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread adoption in Muslim communities , as a devastating government report today revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers , and town councils to disc@@ ern evidence of electoral errors due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to protect shut @-@ off tapes outside of elec@@ tive cab@@ ines to protect frigh@@ tened voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should lead a card to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a vot@@ er has to name his name and address . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , when they vote on their votes in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from un@@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial ruin that goes with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a special court decided that the reign@@ ing Mayor Lut@@ fort Rah@@ man was to be removed from the corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner , &quot; and that he had brought his critics to silence with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have conducted his campaign on the basis of the fact that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person was chosen as someone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric suggested that , throughout the country , there was evidence for fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , he expressed itself alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding evi@@ denti@@ als to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it is said : &quot; as proof that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Alban@@ ian background . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric discussed 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit let@@ ter@@ heads to stop &quot; re@@ aping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires even harder registration checks to prevent the electoral list used for immigration and social fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering options , voters are considering asking for your ID . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not use removable ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to perform systematic reviews on the nationality of a person , in order to ensure that they are eligible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic letter of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition , that political activists deal with full mail@@ ings and envel@@ opes of post@@ age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up barriers for electoral centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change in the law , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in electoral centres .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; request , that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that staff generally assert that voters go alone to the elec@@ tive cabin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case , no criminal charges were made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the elec@@ tive court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty for a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; of the election departments of the Town Hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country carries a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler double tun@@ er and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio have come out this week via the French cycling team Pau@@ line Fer@@ rand @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympic marathon is by no means the only athlete to compete in gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when one is allowed to believe in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens at the moment , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olympic games that have more than one resem@@ b@@ lance to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides K@@ ates double @-@ go@@ ver on the racing track , many people on the internet point out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush to Twitter after images , on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I probably take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the all@@ uring simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athletic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Inc@@ eption Editor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another continuing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian silver medal swi@@ mmer Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va has more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans of an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others enjoyed the simil@@ arities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; theory in the space provided : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face and eyes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other popular compar@@ isons covered Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their smile that is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas is similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer called &quot; as low and &quot; during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off , when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200 outdoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mac@@ don@@ ald who was caught on board in the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; color &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old chin@@ ese has lost the connection baby . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too excited , retired as a pig , died like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you for that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the floating relay 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; viewers across Canada responded quickly online , after they were shocked by the sound and language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did the C@@ BC comment@@ ator say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ in from China , &quot; As a pig died ? &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get it , that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old chin@@ ese has lost the union , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many spoke to him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Twitter users did not go back when they heard how un@@ sensi@@ tively By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you reproduce the C@@ BC and Canada , and makes us look like R@@ assists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment on a swimming performance was ir@@ radi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for over 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
comment colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC copied his ap@@ ologies with more than 90 other Twitter users , compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the network ap@@ ologi@@ zed , too , and issued a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible to broadcast them out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make one clear , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they were inappropriate and an un@@ fortunate formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald used to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have referred to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there was no intention and I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged about woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of the business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothing in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try out under@@ pants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked at how she looked at it and put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Pri@@ mark Store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ bi@@ ed the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went on and left the shop without buying anything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she with@@ drew the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , and went out again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bother@@ ed by anyone watching or thinking about the person who could buy the pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how contradictory to think that someone would take under @-@ trousers having another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to withdraw the garments after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had them and went out and did not wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it something safer for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around for your rob@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are approaching from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your att@@ acker and &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder , before hitting it with your free el@@ bow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat him with his knees in the gro@@ in and twist while the att@@ acker cl@@ ings against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before they move backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but remember that in a rob@@ bery , it is most secure to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a guide
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British travel@@ er with@@ drew his immune system and lit@@ le of a serious test , laying down some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before leaving any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and tell us what to do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea to lick the sink of a draw toilet , which has been used by thousands of others , may be totally revol@@ ting , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ine by travelling through the world , and ate wonderful things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from public money to train stations to sin@@ king kno@@ bs of toilets , the task was definitely put under a sample &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing he declined , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his sample stroke showed a lumin@@ ometer number of over 4,000 units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after her L@@ umin@@ ometer number was above 4000 units , whereas freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will not lick here anything here , because it is disgu@@ sting here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Nik@@ o Vu@@ ori@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with that we said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is associated with the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and , with the documentary , we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had made some of the things that I had instructed him , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ social family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a damage amounting to £ 50,000 because they had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing association found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the walls had holes , wooden floor@@ boards were torn up , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family has been res@@ ett@@ led , and it is assumed that it now lives in a private accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , working for the property management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I believe people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is probably considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family is not@@ orious , and its reputation is likewise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had three sons who had lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bat , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , stri@@ des and floods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , was an order for anti@@ social behaviour in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neighbours said they had to fight them on the street , and regularly called up the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner viol@@ ently from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors , who said that their lives were made to hell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we lived 20 years beside them , and it was always bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the countless times we say the police here , are incredible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we stood up , because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have taken the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant should admini@@ ster any responsibility for their behavior and their family , since a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation is always the last step taking into account Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extreme and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ ging on the floor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; workers of the house administration will now have to move garbage mountains , which surround the house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Skel@@ don got a fine , after she was found guilty of the possession of a class B Dro@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police say that they are going to hi@@ ring tenants , who do not comply with the rules of the house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not adhere to the house rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is about those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall Police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour , which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists in Portugal are pan@@ i@@ cked , after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet on the beach is flying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ ana P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the air forces placed an incredible fall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the air forces stated that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the moment , in which frigh@@ tened tourists begin to panic , after an eff@@ lu@@ ent Jet crashing over a full beach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the military plane near the beach section at Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal , dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew on the beach section in Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the transmission mills , without first seeing what was coming through the clouds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew twice really very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists at Av@@ eiro &apos;s beach were in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sting that security was at no time at risk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where four people on Madeira Island fell to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the Portuguese air forces admitted that the pilot had to fly as deep as possible due to the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Super@@ cup : bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sevilla - the FC Barcelona , on Sunday , is fighting for the first step in the new football season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup east@@ ward against FC Sevilla , the back@@ match climbs three days later in Camp No@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dou@@ ble@@ eder must abst@@ ain from eating with the under@@ stated cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing European league champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who rides the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with Bar@@ ca &apos;s intervention in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo for the time being . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen were competing in Barcelona for two years , as the number one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect , coach Luis En@@ rique decided to make a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er stays in most of the remaining applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ fun@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sev@@ ille again has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with so far , Barcelona is the record winner in this race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 &quot; ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the World Ranking List awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour @-@ Fin@@ al@@ tournament and Olympia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese J@@ un Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected , and made the title among each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , Chinese would pick the single title in the character of the Five @-@ R@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea , was not Chinese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between sets and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had pulled back to the grand@@ stand , and left their prot@@ ectors on top of each other in a fair competition alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the match itself was unexpectedly one @-@ sided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his 28 year old opponent , Ma had really to fight only in the first set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that he set the tempo on the plate , and left Z@@ hang only a total of 13 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , nevertheless enough breathtaking ball@@ ads were to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Miz@@ ut@@ ani , the game for bronze was won against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his quarter@@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the White @-@ rus@@ hing had been treated with a Ri@@ pp@@ l injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympic Fourth in a similar way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump imag@@ ines &quot; massive problems &quot; in the election campaign
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave the weaknesses of his campaign in the Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rare moment , in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns , such as correspon@@ dents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; having thrown 16 rival out of the race in his own republi@@ can camp , doubts are now growing in the fight for the White House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for assistance in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bl@@ aming false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
convert republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ors in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the transmitter CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does nothing else than to tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to press reports , the party should have threatened to strike funds to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger than the arms of the Congress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ way fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C aims to set up a disciplinary committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair in Rio de Janeiro , Kenya is threatened with athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a fraud trial in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee , in order to investigate the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village gave a urine test under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case to make its own investigations , an IL@@ AF speaker shared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will make an assessment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and , as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , left the trial and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 at Beijing WM @-@ Vi@@ per , more than 800 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four days before , Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics deleg@@ ate Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have informed the athlete of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests , against cash payments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to media reports , he was alleged to have been arrested at the Nairobi airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Kenya , following numerous dop@@ ing violations , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , special athletes from Kenya and Russia were especially targeted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the summer games in Brazil , the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the WA@@ DA Kenya adopted from the list of countries their dop@@ ing fight against the rules of the WA@@ DA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have always been raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this type of sport and systematically ged@@ opt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria , as tragic lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli was a surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of the Maria a youth room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he ra@@ ves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and their melody .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she re@@ members love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , because it &apos;s musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is therefore wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli recalls the compli@@ ment , &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his glan@@ ces , it is his life ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the West Side Story is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we took the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York and the New York residents did not want them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the same topics , and today they are as convincing as at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; London School Girl , who joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school girls who left London last year to join the IS died in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family had heard of her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s strongh@@ old in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war torn country and return to England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good in this is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks connected to a war zone - people from ever making this decision , &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria , and within a few months she became a widow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will stay in the case of electoral victory in Gar@@ land as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ land &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority leader in the Senate , Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell , believes that the next president will appoint Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s successor to the Supreme Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not spoken to Clinton , if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he praised Gar@@ land and said , Clinton &apos;s team would not worry for un@@ rest with a new candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the US Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the nom@@ ination of the Guard , be the lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also noted , Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tre@@ ats wants neck calendar for women , and for men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere , to bring a 1970 @-@ year @-@ inspired pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but instead of famous naked people , they would like to find the next generation of Top@@ models for their N@@ U Mus@@ es calendar for 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine was distinguished by Old@@ school play@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , he believes that the calendar also does . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classic nu@@ dity , where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models can submit their images online or personally , with open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass ev@@ asion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not adapt and lo@@ oses Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ proximity Stiftung Dialog and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting tens of thousands of prot@@ esters , who flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term it could even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; become &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; believes the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the hard occurrence of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expects Germany to be a mass flight to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey over the medium term , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight against minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government already out@@ war@@ ted Kurdish high bur@@ sts in months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds fled to Turkey on the run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the frozen put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will start again in Europe if they are further oppressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that assimil@@ ates refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association compla@@ ined of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Alban@@ ian cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or sold in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief of the Association demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement , too , feared the escape of many Turks abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brand@@ marking as Gü@@ len @-@ Pend@@ ant destroys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not adapt and lo@@ oses Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alist and Sa@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ drew Foundation Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks presented the biggest group of asylum seekers recognised in Germany before the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of June 30 , this has 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognized as asylum @-@ justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , they do not find war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum Rights according to the Basic Law are strictly political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not get anything from summer election campaign , and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they understood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 , the State Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for stupid as so far it is not : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the locals , who are to be convinced of the electoral fighters , are on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the holi@@ day@@ makers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so don &apos;t choose the country day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays are hel@@ pers who infl@@ ate the posters , distribute air ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and end up votes in the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign just close to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot phase , if you can tell it at all , has just begun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting , how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his wholesale posters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he travels across the land , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ted a little with the people , just as he did his legendary word @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , sea @-@ ering has cold feet and Chancellor Merkel is responsible for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We create the &quot; have accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you are at the right place at the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel , twice , to big documents ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also a pity not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual competition stand@@ ings on market places and in front of shopping centers with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union , too , has noticed that in the country you are clearing the base that it has to make a strong effort to find a way to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are doing it like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the country &apos;s expan@@ ses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the council of the CD@@ U electoral fighter Kok@@ ert is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in surveys , the Social @-@ Democrats last 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear at 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they make a modern virtue out of holidays , and largely lay their election campaign on the Internet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the regional leader Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , green elec@@ tors embar@@ k on a search for local vocal folds under the vac@@ ation@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ vy straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gische lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ remedi@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those responsible for construction , starting at 5.@@ 30@@ am and ending at 20 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are everywhere praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is also no default .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , the construction site was laid down as planned to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the award ceremony will also be awarded to those responsible for the construction work , for example when it comes to the establishment of cabin trips . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has been mig@@ rated on Monday to the south and the road block in O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen has been abol@@ ished and the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again been lifted , the traffic situation within the village has been relaxed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the citizens can now travel on both sides by O@@ fan@@ d@@ ingen , the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the deputy head of Chief Florian King , responsible for the traffic @-@ related management of the rehabilitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ street , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ land had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ ws were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sig@@ nage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , some trucks had fra@@ yed in residential areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community reinforced the M@@ ös@@ singen sen@@ sing vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made herself aware of the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already , two to three per minute have been heated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 77 per hour kilometers , the quick@@ est was on the way in the pace @-@ 30 zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the construction site has been moved , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the business people at the B 27 , it is only a little consol@@ ation that the street is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to break@@ through@@ s in them allows everyone to look through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight drop , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the balance sheet is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bars are most heavily exploited , along the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants had &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must be happy about each euro , sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales revenue accounts for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the street was thrown back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had to release half of his associates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows other districts where more funding was handled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it points to the long history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also very beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his family cli@@ mates are returning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the impact of the B 27 construction on his clients for the greatest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in her long @-@ standing history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the name of the fight against terror , it is constantly scre@@ wed to laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now proposes a thick security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what has a D@@ ul@@ ment status to do with terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what does the coalition partner say to all of that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère sets the verse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are politically acceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even so , I em@@ ulate myself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as an interior minister , he was on the ver@@ ge of results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gave a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have already announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority is to take care of ch@@ opping encrypted communication is not new . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements for passenger data and arms law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partially , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second attempt for proposals not to be done with the SPD : he wants to impose sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ cking the jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cle@@ ars the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he does not consider this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the co@@ ali@@ tions partner does not have any chance anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few new ideas , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , also present . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have , in part , in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for detention of people prior to deportation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees who are targeted specifically in the country should check their smartphones in advance , and disclose social media accounts for a safety review . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with D@@ ul@@ ls for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers out to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of them are politically and legally protected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them are still un@@ finished , and ask questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memory , for example - the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people worried about the high number of refugees concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and things that imp@@ eded the people deeply , could not be cl@@ inging even in election days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inner security has moved enormously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past days , it was high between the two parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only a gar@@ sti@@ ger argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy of some of the ministers of the Interior , in which the resort leaders also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère ar@@ gues here , too , to reconci@@ le sounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from a return from the double pass , he is nothing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to re@@ charge you , do not make sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he concerns constitutional objec@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional and whether it is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to be revealed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot in it , which could make a dispute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , also the SPD is trying to benefit from the issue of inner security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alled carefully and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite diesel engines , the delivery volumes are rising worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not running around in all markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the recall action , there is vor@@ tex around a term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of deliveries , Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in July , the Volkswagen core brand f@@ atten@@ ed particularly in Western Europe and thus loaded the entire sale , as announced in the Da@@ x company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head of brand head of brand Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , the weaker figures from July mainly led to two sales days in Europe less than in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , there has been a purchasing reset in some core markets through &quot; changing economic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU , a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the USA , where the ab@@ at@@ ement was first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great support for VW , is the Chinese market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , the mainly affected house brand of the Lower Saxony will not get off any further by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from January to July , group sales of Fred Kap@@ pler could further advance a sale of sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a software , Volkswagen was manipul@@ ated with the use of a software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany alone , VW expects about 2.5 million cars to be retro@@ fitted to the workshops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the upgrade , the motorway toll is a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was meant on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reason is legal intri@@ c@@ acies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen guaranteed its German customers now , however , a guarantee of well @-@ equipped diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , this would have confirmed VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after retro@@ fitting , and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that for example , customers can come to a workshop half a year after the retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the interests of the customer it is important to avoid that in any case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal@@ ous scandal , there is no uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future pen@@ al interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case , and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal austerity needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; banks stock money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund is calling for this fee from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 costs in future will be 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been taking 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie at me in the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the money , &quot; said the chief executive officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the cost will now continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most clients would have understanding , and changed to other forms of investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not possible to wear them alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some German banks therefore have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 , with pen@@ al interest rates for deposits starting from 3 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele , &quot; which is well @-@ equipped by fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank if they care for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; founded in 1911 , the G@@ mund Co@@ operative Bank has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at present , no further banks are known to the cooperative association Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokesman Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the President of the German National Bank and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into negative toward private customers is very , very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition is tough , and the migration of investors is threatening competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , customers in Germany do not like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
destination plates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lonely , middle aged men love sheets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before you rush to the comment section to skip it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ame men &apos;s middle @-@ age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to You@@ go@@ v , the re @-@ emergence of records is not due to a boom in millenni@@ als who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who recently bought a record , are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the heart Soh@@ o slowly cat@@ ers to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were resident - there are still a handful of fantastic plate @-@ specialty shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch the camera off for the next part , in which I stand near to different men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind through observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( data number : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day because of a meeting in London and walks through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is he a collector , do I ask ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I already guess , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy items he sold when he was young and crude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is my truck .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers who meet him meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback and will see them buying their old records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I conducted , people usually get rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this would explain the boom of followers of the record @-@ re@@ union of a certain age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to recognize that record shops offers a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took part in the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from objects which call happy youth memories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a simple way to mentally employ yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee from a plate stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I smooth@@ en through a stack of bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly entering . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colorful audience as I go in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and women middle aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the stores above - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ - packed pop instead of experimental jazz bla@@ sts from the loudspeakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of them looks very lonely , but the psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to det@@ ach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it rather makes a window @-@ shop as a wholesale purchase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she does not deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record owners : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while I give the appearance of mut@@ ating jeans in jeans , I watch a group of young girls who think about a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of panels from Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential panels for an average collection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and to send some customers to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though my research results show that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they are un@@ accounted for at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female colle@@ cti@@ ves that exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not stro@@ lling through sheet shops of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they avoid the paraly@@ zing view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old impro@@ per who sha@@ kes nothing about the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argue that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary stores , sell , sell , bar@@ ber services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture has argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which offer a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court with the fact that businesses and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they also led out that the temporary stores and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people , in need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who were doing the 72 temporary jobs , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely track@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the places that was threatened by the erosion was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly operated and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people signed the petition to maintain the Kids &apos; Café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the Olympics , Martin remains fighting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his dis@@ appointing appearance at the time of the Olympic time , Tony Martin is not willing to let go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep watching the World Cup in view , remain confident and fight further , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the Zu@@ ck@@ erh@@ ut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to me , it is hard to comment on the time of yesterday &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must analyze in peace , which reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will see everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; watching other people watching video games is a huge entr@@ ust , of which Microsoft will also benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Microsoft announced how much money flows for the tak@@ eover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ am joined the start with his offer only in January , and has more than 100,000 users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can watch others while playing , but also intervene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for accident prevention , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , on highway construction sites or refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary speed @-@ polishing , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days , and the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; variable speed limits as well as driving b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the raised condition , one can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with tow hit@@ ch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so that it is not easily cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way disappear in a simple outer shell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic , in various federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even foreign authorities are flas@@ hing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , following an order of 150 units last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain takes silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by , after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class gets gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening with the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master class in handling , side st@@ eppe , back@@ stage , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defeat was sweet@@ ened by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the definite defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight years ago , she lost any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , they only lost one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fi@@ ji had a wonderful time , and the attacks G@@ Bs were fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au passed in the corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely touched the ball .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a prepar@@ atory T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the seventh minute Kan@@ j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ova put a touch down in the right corner , and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new beginning , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still learned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , it is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed over to Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favour of the Süd@@ se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans whose fans sang and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another experiment in the last few seconds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB ki@@ cked down in the grass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier on that day , Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ yle Brown put the ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot @-@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was only present when she came to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without a tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports that laid down such a scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th in@@ soles , which is also unprecedented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins that slide over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind each gold in the herd there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make the difference , and it was no more assistant than the coach who was not able to survive this day than was diagnosed with cancer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , he was ris@@ ky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able , and that &apos;s what they did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been a rather bad situation .
it changes a bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trio were lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum , if under such circumstances it was the right term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I needed money , so I had to get better again soon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be sufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how it starts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rowing to itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ breaking morning with doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in Afghanistan , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have wished for a better person , or a better trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning did not have a race over the last five years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lead in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really important not to let yourself be carried away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking forward to doing something great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race whatever we did . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , the couple will take a break before making decisions about their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV adv@@ entur@@ er Steve Back@@ shall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was all so new for me , and I was so stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 31 years , exemplary for clarity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the Water Sports Association &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a small , Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some time ago , it was the name of the original sound of the Bavarian Radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia ev@@ oked the constra@@ int association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group is considered exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller stands for 31 years in the ken@@ nel association , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he was retired at the age of 65 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the water @-@ purpose Association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water each year and supplies 32 towns and meadows with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the congregations are the congregations of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for further cities and municipalities , there are water supply contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was hired as a water@@ keeper in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the association in 1988 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency service on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , sale of land in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the modernization of water pipes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never stopped any stop and I have always added new things , because water li@@ des and drinking water is the most important food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her speech , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for over 31 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association , and he has settled the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the pond stone group to lower the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , lau@@ ded water @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is the best water@@ man , and he was a faithful fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and restructuring of the association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe break@@ age at the high tank at Kirch@@ hoff on a third of January . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at minus 17 degrees we had to work throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management of the drinking water management association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko begins openly with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other concerned parents : &quot; they must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she must die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the now eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago was well advanced , and I &apos;m now studying in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something about two years when I sang in Scala , he remembered nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .

relationship at Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shooting at partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself to us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , and after him I became public prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the way with the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 feet tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a smooth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the police released a photo of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the man has a bald head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could still carry the weapon , so the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you see Sven S. , you should call 110 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competent police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the Ta@@ ther@@ ing or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a human being was killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we are not saying , &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens threatened by the industry from green electricity funding are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Reform in the German steel industry , it remains in the German steel industry , the Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday Edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption , to cash out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry had additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a fundamental agreement with the European Commission after talks with the Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG change of 20 percent falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even this , too , is not le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , IG Metall welcome the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the success of Gabriel for the steel industry has special significance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; is the first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets are also to be weighed in the reform of the emission rights treaty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffered over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the situation worsen@@ ed further , when China &apos;s world @-@ largest producer of producers produced tons of steel on the world market in view of the ailing domestic demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European manufacturers acc@@ use price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , import duties imposed on imported steel have effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have bri@@ gh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unclear , however , how sustainable the price recovery is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp was cautious on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rupp wanted not to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the German steel industry , some 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cautious in July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the prior @-@ year period , like the Steel Union of Steel on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a brief up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced amount came back the second month in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
community ; mind and health : singing is good sen@@ iors
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the singing was accompanied by Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp : as a young girl she was in school choir , teaching music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from several perspectives , singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most senior singers sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a chor@@ us is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , means H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for doing so , senior citizens train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you demand your lungs regularly , your daily routine will not be so fast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German working community of senior citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher value ; it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through song lyrics and especially melodies , people are self @-@ mistaken for long @-@ lying events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , L@@ enz explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time concentrating on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm , and adapting to the other singers - this is a huge cognitive challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially older people who live alone , exercise so not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through singing in the choir , means H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the sense of self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear it when a sound goes wrong ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior chor@@ us , one can simply join . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many cities offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can directly contact the church or the church leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many veter@@ an choirs can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the internet research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to sing , you should definitely join a choir . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; singing is good for the soul , and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for every age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers on the cries of the young
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hanover , bi@@ ologists have investigated the effect that cat babies sleep on adult animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to her surprise , the def@@ rost also didn &apos;t let the males cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
female cats can recognize the patho@@ gen of cat babies in the mi@@ sty of the little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they react by ten percent faster on the sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great trouble , like scientists from the veter@@ inary university and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , however always the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ sty of less and strongly arous@@ ed young for the males either are not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a previous investigation , the research team found that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cries with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , nine adult males and eight females were observed from the shelter of the MH@@ H . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were played for a pack of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and brothers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results in a meaningful way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they turned faster to the speaker , when this calls played the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this ability may be con@@ genital , or develop with sexual maturity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby noise several times in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were pregnant or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski interven@@ es with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , another important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the Du@@ eling of the Arch@@ du@@ sts between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with the suspension of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal occup@@ ants should not be com@@ promised . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , it is also not possible to stop football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against the former strong I@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the prosec@@ ut@@ ors issued an arrest warrant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sü@@ kis@@ r should be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Erdo@@ gan declared the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public squares all over the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the whole country , the sport is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not affiliated with the friends of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what unites the majority of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the fans agree , whether their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will especially come back to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , Cologne presented its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first playing time as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; rejo@@ iced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has completed the season in an excellent way , and secured the cup to his team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ O. in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; in the Europa League say good @-@ bye . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the South of Li@@ g , there was only six . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season figures as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ prot@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig , laid the foundation for the 14th title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following the attempt to attempt the political situation in the country after his EM trip , the Gom@@ ez announced that the Treaty of Florence was issued by the Treaty of Florence , following the attempt of the coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; cited the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club director F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to do so , the Stür@@ mer would have to be ready to ren@@ ounce about a third of his valued annual fare , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping : these athletes have med@@ als , chances at Olympia in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin , 34 years old , has already been closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova can &apos;t start in Rio .
other leading athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh at this - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme of dop@@ ing is , as before , the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer , Juli@@ ja Je@@ al@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined about the right to play after a dop@@ ing lock , was mar@@ ched off mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 m chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scenery : she was still in the hall , and provoked her appearance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a fix@@ ture that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience burst into a ro@@ aring tower . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are numerous other athletes , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and former world champion has been running even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times the world champion had to sit down in 2010 after taking the pain@@ kill@@ ers Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che after surgery , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positively by the banned stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ ish consumption and was suspended for six months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , the four far@@ th@@ est throws go to the account of the great gold favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete was recognized as many med@@ als later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games received CA@@ S from the International Sport Court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had suffered chi@@ ves and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her home journey , she planned for early September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ gar@@ ch , Austrian citizens are still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; police officers were killed and about 20 people injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ on@@ ation near the seaside resort Pat@@ ong , popular among tourists , was injured by a taxi driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban worker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities in a flower @-@ guard , the explo@@ sives went into the air in front of the re@@ vier of the coast police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in ch@@ al on the south @-@ eastern coast called for several injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was too early to manifest themselves on possible motives , but probably it was the actions of the Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical for the bomb attacks of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks do not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokesman in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , the authorities have received intelligence clu@@ es on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they have not been informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still , it is unclear what group is behind the attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police advised her officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bombs , but mostly they do not direct themselves against tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the present bombing explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department recommends to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , they are not advised to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution , which was dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to cause chaos while the country was moving towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Military Un@@ ta , who took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , is benef@@ iting from having brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the rebel@@ li@@ ous rebel forces in the extreme south of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict , more than 6,@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a year ago , a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine had been killed in Bangkok - most of them foreign tourists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the most bloody attack in the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted at the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several offices , the constitu@@ ents of the Federal Government have also examined the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; said the Federal Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aten at the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , we observe the movement as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity through est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia , observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &apos; identical movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the chief executive officer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a youth fair@@ er language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the propaganda is to address people emotion@@ ally , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young people are particularly vulnerable .
that is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not know about that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the deciding factor is whether such persons have control over the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view of the significant increase in illegal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new right terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , however , we have found that it can give legal @-@ terrorism structures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; , or the Frei@@ tal Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or groups of groups form attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognizable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous groups were created at the regional level , or in social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ate expressed concern about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people , who previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is wor@@ rying .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the suspect victims of asylum @-@ lod@@ gings have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes which were not at all wrong with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected for example CD@@ U , the SPD and the Left , which were then radi@@ cal@@ ised by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not always , the Olympics or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Centre , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly swa@@ m that it was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he simply disappeared , no matter how far the detail was selected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it was rather his not just athletic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old take part in the Olympic Games ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the international swimming association , the Ethiop@@ ian received a special start@@ page . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ asi@@ t wanted to do something different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quickly , the first nick@@ names were made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some media designated him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; prosperity basket , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; was fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of fre@@ est@@ yle and played no part . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the 2000 Olympics in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ba gave media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to start riding alone in a run over 100 meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ba was fired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Tr@@ ump sees the im@@ pending electoral defeat not so narrow
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Republi@@ can candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , speaks at an election campaign in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , he will go on holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential election in November , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , he called the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
post goes into trade with electric transpor@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an electric motor vehicle of the Deutsche Post , in action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interest of other companies on the vehicle , obviously , is big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the post plans to sell its electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter also .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly , the Group will start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the coming year , the post will also offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into third parties for sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokesman on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months now , the company has been checking whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der said there are always questioning , e.g. by craftsmen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company will shortly join the mass production of the vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in post@@ own manufacturing , the company plans to construct up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ger@@ der had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and long @-@ term a complete switch to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can imagine that we orbit the entire fleet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2014 , the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ als suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K confirmed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann , the more uncertain , will remain the longer the success promised by him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the helm of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : following again dis@@ appointing business figures and the resignation of corporate governance the worldwide number Five of the sector is in front of a new beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the year , Gf@@ K Executive Chef wants to leave the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of 1 September , the management board will take over the management board of the Executive Board . Gerhard Haus@@ chu@@ ck , former member of the board , communicated the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the position of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the revers@@ al , the company called &quot; different views &quot; for the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , a company spokesman did not want to mention the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , whoever will lead the market research company will be unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , with shareholders , the disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago was great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2011 , Mr Hart@@ mann has been part of the Gf@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after 5 years the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become rest@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that would be the case with BMW , would that make the quot@@ ations so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company could not stop loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales stood by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the first half @-@ year , sales of 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million euros were shr@@ inking by 3.4 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were mainly imp@@ acted by the under@@ stated value of the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corporate value depreciation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , led the Group to a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still managed a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ horns in dit@@ ch : eight injured
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the event of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ fa@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the passengers suffered severe injuries , divided the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to diver@@ t her information in an opposite direction , some of which drove on the opposite way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bus arrived right from the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people couldn &apos;t leave the bus independently , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue carri@@ ages and a emergency ambul@@ ance arrived at the accident site on the state road 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ injured passengers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district , P@@ ew@@ sum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost per cubic meter of wastewater is 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ chen@@ berg 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ore 3.@@ 64 Euro ( so far 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will be increased at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a revised calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ haus@@ er ( CS@@ U ) reported , under the permission of the budget Kul@@ mb@@ ach , the administrative office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach stated that under cover@@ ages for these se@@ wer systems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf Market is committed to operating costs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the wal@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rates of revenue are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as head of the Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt , a new calculation of the fees for the sewage systems of the market community was necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt explained that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small , with a very low waste water intake , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the small distribution base , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , wastewater flow in all three systems is slightly decreasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , in the back @-@ up calculation period in all three plants not least because of their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses came to a considerable extent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for the thi@@ ghs , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the waste water plant in Az@@ endorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nearly 20 years , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to these extraordinary expenses the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , Schmidt explained that the market community of large entertainment costs was spar@@ ed in the waste water systems over the past 20 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the view from stone houses , the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ ba@@ cht@@ al sewage treatment plant could not be expanded because it is a deficit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; national statistics show that in July , inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % have been recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; free time and culture ( 6.@@ 3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prices remained as in advance of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anim@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me effect as an Asian cartoon critici@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the filters are non @-@ bloo@@ ded , stand@@ alone tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all abor@@ tions get to the public .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , Snap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised themselves in which they were accused of promoting the app black@@ face promoting or white skin as beauty ideal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when this week gave some users a filter which gave them sm@@ oul@@ ders , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yel@@ low@@ ish face . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they asked whether these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem , that the company has diversity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended to pay tribute to anim@@ e characters , not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced racism , reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and gall@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish layer has been moved to the falling extre@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pit@@ stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the appliances we all keep in hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people , who are more diverse than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats produces a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things will remain un@@ noticed than before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , working as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an essay for medium and a telephone interview , she said that she believes that race @-@ related controversy is reflecting a lack of diversity among the setting practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the large part white , only male leadership , and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either I have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely un@@ answered Snap@@ chat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as private enterprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , it refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ woman the company recently set up a personnel responsible , focusing on sub@@ mis@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said she would have closed her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military service adul@@ ter@@ ated IS@@ IS sec@@ rec@@ y intelligence agencies established Committee of Congress
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed thou@@ ghtful information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground in a report on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can Com@@ mittees , Intelligence Com@@ mittees and the Ar@@ med Forces Command , reports on great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence teams who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a more positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on the ground and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; quoted a newspaper article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com reach the top of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ten @-@ page report reveals persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 , in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts are exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements in front of the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Cent@@ Com members publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings , while the investigations will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Cent@@ Com &apos;s investigations are underway through the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of instruc@@ tional assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; damaged the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave exc@@ essively little space for different opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats stated that no evidence was found on the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts , with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday , by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon General In@@ spec@@ tor , which was taken up by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokesman , announced that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the Congress while investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions about the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ gation , which is now made by a growing number of members of the Department of Defense ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of Z@@ wis@@ s of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , auth@@ ored a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , stating the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; general Austin went into retirement in April , and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US is winning fourth match in ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK is standing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after shooting three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also took the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that knows , however : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first place will be a little longer the strong Dutch rider , who will lead the other group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have caused a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey club in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National Player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became a trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we did not have the work@@ load in London , which we now have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have been able to carry out the ruin completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake ring in the first half of the game with a return handling from the local area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then pulled the ball into the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final door in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has a run .
same as B@@ am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wherever you are , as late as it is , the Olympic Games are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a fast relay race between competition and striving . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick , which is passed from the watch strap to the s@@ wimm@@ ers for tri@@ athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t turn on television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the fight between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm with a logo , would have been built by sponsors and well @-@ being TV advertising , if it were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air pi@@ rou@@ ghts , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always have the chest swimming , and may it rule for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if I should make a modest argument for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many people I had questioned were not aware that it was an Olympic sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the USA sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had an athlete up until 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese , and Canadi@@ ans for the women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold med@@ als from London this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider &apos;s char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown school that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert , but only a dev@@ oti@@ onal enthusiasm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending asc@@ esis - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially combines it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rising champi@@ ons jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a series of falling moves ( turning , h@@ eli@@ ght and sal@@ tos ) before they end up on their feet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic program , you will be rated according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio for each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; med@@ al@@ lists have to go on in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down on the playground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they chase not only the finish line or the output wall , but in the television broadcast also another high goal : the world or the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing , even when watching these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wolves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Zen as the competition , it is only possible for the Olympic Games to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the women &apos;s qualifying and final hours will be staged on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the fin@@ als from 14.@@ 00 on both days , as part of an afternoon block . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the Olympic man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the Ang@@ apes and objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male U.S. Tur@@ ner proposed recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community , according to the The Wall Street Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Generation Prot@@ ects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , met the government &apos;s violent opposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses say that tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia just collap@@ sing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent months , protests erup@@ ted against the government and expanded into more and more areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , thousands of people flooded the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses testified that polic@@ emen were shot and killed on dirty un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the head of the UN Human Rights Council demands a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Nigeria , Ethiopia is the rich@@ est country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , and the dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many were sent into exile or imprisoned , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of soil to the stran@@ gle@@ hold , in relation to the power of the ruling coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a widely critic@@ ised election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the final seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , tensions are rising along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den who were forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the past few years and could arm themselves again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness erup@@ t after years of h@@ ashing down under the surface , now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in recent years many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more common and improved the internet services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the government blocked access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially among protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several young Ethiop@@ ians gave , that they gathered themselves to protests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are mainly Christian High@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this is also changing , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are coordin@@ ating under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had been Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts say he was particularly interested in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content , and using special commission@@ ers to manipul@@ ate enemies and to make them harmless . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively minor reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia was experiencing such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to statements by analysts apparently by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; development experts praised Ethiopia leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but obviously , this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ ple@@ tion of the Ethiop@@ ian government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more common@@ place in social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts say that protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a base for D@@ ron@@ es flights over neighboring Somalia , even though she recently reported that she closed this base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains Obama &apos;s claim that IS@@ IS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump was trying to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multi @-@ reiter@@ ated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , the &quot; Fo@@ under &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this clarification asked new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also brings his comrades who seek to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position , to declare statements which he could not have meant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump moved back to the asser@@ tion that he really did not intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an early morning tweet on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , where Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the conservative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump , he remembered that Mr. Obama would destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted to know nothing about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Twitter he warned that Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes , and that he found their speech boring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of July , he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course , I told the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics , and then back to demand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive , and if necessary , &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more corro@@ sive tone since his demand values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was released on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but while he is increasingly in focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the in@@ convenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent def@@ enders , gave himself great effort to defend the candidate from Thursday in a CN@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani was asked whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ ers , completely wrong and so it happened because he with@@ drew the troops out of Iraq . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that Clinton &apos;s government served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Obama , allowing IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania , on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of being pre@@ occupied on each of his words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the office of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once driving over the price of the market , Café is back in Green@@ point &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a chin@@ ese café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displaced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced the b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
native people affected it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ aster wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap shop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if New York is change , then it is also new discovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a resur@@ rec@@ ted Ver@@ b Cafe last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coffee is still good , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old coffee bar , the owner and managing director of the new coffee bar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a customer offered to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , considered a lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ nish such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are natural fis@@ sur@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the café does not serve beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently on a Sunday , Re@@ be@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira has been such a customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the club regularly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even after she was moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the club had closed , she gave a coffee drink for a while , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal is another long @-@ standing and loyal customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he went there before the work , and inevitably appointed the same thing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I got a quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and assimil@@ ate new ingredients into the menu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not succeed , that the soap shop took the old business space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for use with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the traditional Polish inhabitants , Green@@ points , also accepted the café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new client has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he prepared to publish them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice loc@@ ale would like to fill and sell cold bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to an adjacent building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café locked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a plentiful meal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a fai@@ ble delic@@ acy for Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its menu on this day was a bit modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pu@@ dding pu@@ dding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the couple lives in Brooklyn Hei@@ ghts , and are both food historians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in its book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they show culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a snack bar in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the stock market in 1929 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the re@@ porter had ordered chi@@ pper roast , the couple found it suitable for a discussion of the food in the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cream cheese and bean bread . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were prepared by an ingredient and a little cheaper , which stretches the ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years before Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teams of women cook for male wheels and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , tense subject , &quot; Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new bud@@ dy diet was just as tense : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es were found to be stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recover food lef@@ to@@ vers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ grass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meat , which was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peculiar mixtures have been tried out , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even wholes@@ ome cuisine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick prepared a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was no popular supplement at lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many of the business recipes , it was typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as never before or since then , fiscal econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - began eating habits of the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household politicians &quot; and the challenge of turning p@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical treats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ pie eating attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ million man from the world to whom he became . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room , and wore a smo@@ king . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was terri@@ bly alien to reality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had called him to stamp an example with his stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as described in the book , the how@@ ling of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roos@@ ev@@ elt led to the fact that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the species of the Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legacy is based on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in writing the book , the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law - for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brick was remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the attack of the wind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , and added that it was a nasty trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of them reluct@@ antly di@@ ved a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amaz@@ ingly , it tasted very bad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E got three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; Some h@@ acked wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he put his own life on the game to help others , Khal@@ ed O@@ mar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo , Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ris@@ ked everything , to save life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died even in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was a member of White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the game , to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to help in the war zone first aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil shield , showing him in an 11 hour rescue of a house from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it made the Syrians a shining symbol of symbol@@ ism , in the horror of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero he never saw himself , said loud in the picture : &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God will see me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before O@@ mar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs across the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath@@ lessness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remnants of the bomb , so that no children are playing with it , &quot; the image rec@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea aboard the S@@ anna research vessel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born in 16@@ 24 , it swi@@ ms with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Greenland ha@@ ie only got offspring with 150 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Greenland hai s@@ wimm@@ ingly at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when it comes to it , acceler@@ ates the five @-@ metre long animal on a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal Science , in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mad , &quot; says Alexander Sch@@ abra@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life span which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland ha@@ vo@@ y become rock @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland ha@@ ia , researchers know correspon@@ d@@ ingly little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her time @-@ ser@@ pent@@ ine was her , when she rep@@ lic@@ ated six animals with a transmitter before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice cream and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly high carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear dis@@ armament searches larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the length of 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the l@@ enti@@ us nucleus had a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from nuclear weapons , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , all larger Greenland ha@@ vo@@ ys had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in its lens core , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k could be 3@@ 92 years old even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the researchers were able to associate the length of an age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland ha@@ ie with the increase evi@@ dently leave at least one and a half centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , this is likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that such methane al@@ em@@ es live above all in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose bac@@ on stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year old har@@ po@@ on tip was caught in front of Alaska . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on a flame @-@ flame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they mature later , and age slowly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the heat loss of one gram of mouse is much greater than with one gram of elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many descendants as possible early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ abra@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the latest session , the municipal council has dealt with issues relating to construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Panel received the communication from Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after clari@@ fying the plot , plot and closing requests and the applications for surve@@ ying could be clari@@ fied , the sale of plots in residential areas &quot; Road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community , Schö@@ nau , attract young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said , bau@@ bles can immediately announce themselves in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to give advice during its September meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to meet even requests for the establishment of further industrial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change its land use plan in sub @-@ sections only in the spring of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the commercial area already designated there is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies in London , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits most from Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W competence field and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU passport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have previously received approval in Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why large US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced their jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lobby member calcul@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance review E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luxembourg has hit a large fund branch , but just as Dublin deals badly with the infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the city has a light commercial real estate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Seine , rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city was standing in place seven , Luxemburg at No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; the I@@ W concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry were working in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a U.S. minist@@ erial judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of legal costs , resulting from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal proceedings with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , Gilead was released from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs such val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i from Gilead , including Mein@@ ingen and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of complaint on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead &apos;s claim to the expense incurred during the defense of the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead that controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck claimed each other and accepted the property on laboratory work that gave Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir Gro@@ z@@ ag , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backed by the US , troops say they have reg@@ ained complete control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; backed by the US forces , the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j was rec@@ ap@@ tured near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned it , said a spokesman for the group on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , based on the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city , are currently the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they released over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ p Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council appointed with the D@@ KS . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are running through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , H@@ illary Clinton published their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the US presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton delivered USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book about their term in the foreign ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declarations for the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his promises to date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers as a reason for his refusal to have a tax check by tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ tons &apos;s election campaign assistant Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to ask questions concerning fortun@@ es , his contributions to char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other compounds , particularly with Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , asking the high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , she also spoke about the topic during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political co announced that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little tax , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants , stating that this could still be the case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton is supporting a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would make sure that individuals make the more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka claimed Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters to exchange tr@@ ump into a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had just been subjected to an I@@ RS tax check , and Tr@@ ump is afraid of voters and not against tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has released tax returns , back to 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an average federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons in 2015 showed that they only obtained USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their major investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 have been tax@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der and fireworks support Tanz@@ anian &apos;s elephant prot@@ ector
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from entering settlements in humans , they throw con@@ doms in them , which are filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea for years , has intensified their support together with the U.S. environmental protection by using volunteers in villages in Northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ invasive approach to protect their houses and crops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday is World Phone Day , dedicated to animal welfare . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities without damaging the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch , and the bubbles in a horn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom pl@@ ung@@ es with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust in the air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a rule , a touch is already sufficient to chase the elephant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a last possibility is a laun@@ cher depicting a gol@@ fer &apos;s fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ osk @-@ construction at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment project of business@@ men with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - however , is just the same as the retail trade in the core city as clearly exp@@ and@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the City Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the proposal for the new construction of a sales@@ ski@@ bus at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new traders , but at this location in exposed locations on the bank of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not go , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin &apos;s hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had not listed Israeli code since Arab guests had &quot; demanded &quot; according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel selection list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
written by Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; ch@@ oked it , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliberate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason behind it was that in the director , there was even more anger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this really is very sham@@ eful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered quite a great resonance on the internet , where people called the whole thing a scandal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some under@@ took the Kemp@@ inski Hotel , that it would have been the alleged for@@ ti@@ fications of Arabic guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was said in another post mentioned that the hotel that is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cursed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct instruction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not be included in the Quick Selec@@ tor List , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokesman for Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has been added .
police force tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students met with the police on Thursday in Sa@@ o Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the difficulties began as police officers tried to dis@@ assemble the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber floors and tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Gover@@ nor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Protest@@ ants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti , against preliminary president Michel Tem@@ er on walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been relieved of office by a vote of the Senate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the international sanctions were lifted up against Iran , interest in Russian companies in the country grew strongly , divided the am@@ bass@@ adors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further commercial expansion is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he noted that the trading rate between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade up@@ swing was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is starting a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Russian representatives were around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries regarding the number of tourists in Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the Ambassador hopes it will change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
search for : beverage market inf@@ ested in forest fires
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rob@@ bery is carried out on Thursday evening to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL , at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the curtain of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed persons who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces were asked by the employee of the beverage market to pick out cash and then presumably escaped with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money was captured , the police did not share . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cul@@ pr@@ its should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters , so relatively small . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; directly from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market , the beverage market is accessible and poorly visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ way and have fled from the gravel parking place situated opposite the parking @-@ house entrance , possibly in the direction B 256 ( ring n@@ ring ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who have observed the crime time ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should report urgently to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer leisure time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the Social Ped@@ ago@@ gic daily group / social group work of the Child Protection Association , Nag@@ old , with their car@@ ers on their summer release in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first week of the school holiday , the lively leisure room Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle was quartered during the first school holiday week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , it went to B@@ enny with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there is a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third trip took us to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the hot days , the group at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own meals , like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop was designed to create beautiful pieces of jewelry made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , four stages were accomplished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all ministers in two years , the senior round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various pilgrimage destinations have been tested and it was finally decided on the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy had a special pilgrimage destination this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bronze , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt were on their way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening before , the pastor sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and distributed the pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Münster cathedral . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a short stimulus with different prayers , songs and written texts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again began to sing a song of specially produced pilgri@@ m songs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the nights , the parish homes of the local parish were available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the second day , on Fur@@ tw@@ angen , we continued to see Gü@@ ten@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags on this were the stage after St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , had to be covered by some 500 metres of altitude and then climbed again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening , the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the lake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously relieved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Cathedral later in the afternoon and passed through the doors of mercy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the pilgrimage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sacri@@ stry and the high altar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next day , it was time for the B@@ reis@@ gau metropolis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , we went back to Hor@@ b by train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner towers home , when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the British team defended the title of London 2012 in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner was the last night in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made himself to E@@ igen . he made the legend hau@@ ghty , when he came home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they repeated the trick , after they only took a modest sixth place in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did this just in time , as a Hin@@ du . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap , trying to close Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y prevailed - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic ch@@ ord in qualifying rounds , but the New Ze@@ al@@ anders were victorious in the first round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his lap , Hin@@ di returned , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of strategy made a large part of the transformation , driving down in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all to allow Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m just here , to do my best and to make a name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic ch@@ ord and defeated the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the Side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des reported that after a weak start he was deliberately falling on the train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he returned this statement later , and there was no objection from England &apos;s ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels with all the GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e as London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three months , we have come together as a team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we came so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a result of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would be the same for the one of Ho@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for three days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels a little lonely , alone to win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two other gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , he had argued with the officers before the qualification as officials called him to measure his height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition that will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ forehand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ des in world record time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UK Team is relying on its strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games , and to win a pair of med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a truly remarkable representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ mas played in the background , the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying signs , as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the future of the melt of Port@@ land is question@@ able because of the lifting of the energy contract
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the stake as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby under@@ mines all supply contracts as the supplying energy company has split .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a subsi@@ dy laid out for 20 years runs out in November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ co@@ a plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect , could be at risk of closure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 Al@@ co@@ a closed the point Henry Schmel@@ zer@@ ei , which last year led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the melt of Al@@ co@@ a in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ co@@ a and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p retain smaller portions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging businesses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L states that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on earnings on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already depreci@@ ated from $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expectation of termination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ a said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the enam@@ el or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el &quot; does not interfere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. company said it completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have entered into force from November this year even if it is still a statement of why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
analysts are warning of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generating set it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September Edition of the Vo@@ gue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z on@@ c@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the c@@ lich@@ é story almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You said that we forgot you ? &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this publicity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began with certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have sm@@ itten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Vo@@ gue , the September issue is the most sold issue of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more than one fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ owed Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the wal@@ tz 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is expected to be so lon@@ es@@ ome , that in the last two years pictures of the Bul@@ letin should be scrut@@ ini@@ zed before the official announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , the mod@@ al &quot; as &quot; models , &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mr@@ s Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true on Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had been one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , J@@ enny &apos;s success does not appeal to everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with her reality TV history , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always tense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these feelings were really high , when the news came out with the appearance J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the point of mis@@ understanding , it seems to pass by the point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September Edition of the Vo@@ gue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tru@@ est sense of the word , it is a super@@ model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her own pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in her free time she is watching TV in Reality TV . presumably , to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; community centres reject 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid operations are rejected annually by the community centres , while the industry relies on the impact of further funding on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land there are already three of five people - mostly older persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation and the like - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ stated , are ready for further cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centres will lose more than 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of Que@@ es@@ land &apos;s community centres , James Far@@ r@@ ell , said that the last survey of the National Association of municipal councils yiel@@ ded that thousands of people have already been rejected every year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ r@@ ell said that without the government &apos;s resolution , the situation would only be worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , workers who have been released by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get help they need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and the Federal Justice Minister , as well as Sen@@ ators from Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to stop these short@@ cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centres and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government has invested in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Campa@@ ign indic@@ ted after co @-@ workers allegedly pulled fire@@ arm
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign was accused of alleged in@@ action after it was announced , that her campaign leader for North Carolina set up a fire@@ arm in February , while in February she was travelling in a je@@ ep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident was described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday at the Landes@@ gericht of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i claimed to have been waited for months , that the matter would be internally regulated before he realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right hand finger on the trigger and ra@@ mmed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having compla@@ ined to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i concluded that at least four other people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was indic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina said that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment people should take action if his rival should be elected H@@ illary Clinton and appoint Ju@@ dge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dump@@ ed Campa@@ ign made it clear that the media would have torn his words from the context and that he would not insti@@ gate violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; b@@ ordin@@ is Compla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for violation of duty duty , and by Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hope Hi@@ cks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pumps were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attempts to contact Philip , just as failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U are notable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the Bild &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , the party is still paraly@@ zing the CD@@ U , which could rise to 23 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , and the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite its slight losses , the Gre@@ ens entered the Schwer@@ iner Land@@ tag despite its slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Parliament by 3 per cent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the survey , in the opinion of Berlin , the survey reported only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent , after 23.@@ 4 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but in front of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , but the pirates wouldn &apos;t miss it in contrast to 2011 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the followers dominate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unit weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not well in the hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the built @-@ in memory used to be eight meg@@ aby@@ tes at the beginning , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , an iPhone is delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator was just 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it computer trade fair in Hanover , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though slowly slow@@ ing down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up similar to a laptop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , a small keyboard and a black and white screen found themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 1996 , no one could suspect that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , everything has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled by Microsoft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , vendors dominate the market , all of which came much later than Nokia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always and everywhere online , that &apos;s today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at some 400 billion euros , global sales will be around € 400 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app vendors and telecommunications companies come together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came to the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the after@@ math . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ Ber@@ ry has to fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the sa@@ ws have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the smartphone is a matter of course , 20 years after its invention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in average , every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn how to get the smartphone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s sphere , in the Siemens executive board responsible for staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , permanent availability is considered a curse and blessing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ ath@@ row won &apos;t only work in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this will be achieved again , by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and an end to youth unemployment in the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who are thinking that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be blin@@ ded on the world stage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 , and they are also wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs to create £ 2@@ 11 billion at wit@@ ty growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row , as well as ensuring our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ad@@ block Plus and Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and M@@ ouse Game &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the software vendors , companies that earn money with online advertising are the same as attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking , a &quot; cra@@ b and mouse game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertisements on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop side would change the coding of his adver@@ ts to make it difficult to detect the indication of which part of the ads page is advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a blog post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and Her combat between the da@@ unting open source community and the conver@@ ters has been in progress since the invention of ad lock@@ ers , and that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has joined the fight , is a strong indication of how high concern advertis@@ ers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display block@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion active users , who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the advertising revenue fac@@ ebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from mobile ad block@@ ers , the company has no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenue , so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad pre@@ fer@@ ential tool &quot; to have more control over it than adverti@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ just blocks new filters would be wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to get more control over people &apos;s hands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women with presum@@ able suicide on Swiss highway &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a woman in the early hours of the morning on Thursday , the police witnesses to witnesses of suspected suicide by several vehicles on a highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a woman in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; fell on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is obvious that a Swiss resident at the age of 49 , who was driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police said that these as well as every witness of the incident asked to report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , shared Gil@@ les Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
was a cl@@ ash prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers cannot be held accoun@@ table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway , it was decided that the mot@@ orists fail to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the free@@ way as it was in the newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent kill@@ ings after having crossed a man and killed a night on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and , on the street , had become unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court found that the police had responded to a call -- a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate models : Venus once was hab@@ itable
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhab@@ itable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists at the God@@ dar@@ d Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have re@@ mitted light @-@ like conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have previously pointed out that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and yet slowly passed away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to shelter life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution , previously suspected of planet scientists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years , was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their oceans were evapor@@ ated , and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as their Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with@@ drew from a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , as we know it today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy reti@@ res as coach of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the summer , I have been thinking about how I could improve this team to give him more depth and to bring it to a higher level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer &apos;s vision and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right to participate in decisions that influence the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic , who hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation , and wish him the best for the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during his debut season Roy won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , and fell five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal and A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike strikes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work struggles for the wage @-@ wage for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties stand for a new round of talks to the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea running by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current conflict , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop a few full day meetings over the next few weeks , starting next year to re @-@ tackle the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , Wood Group reduced its rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said that extra cuts give the company the space needed to come through the market down@@ turn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June , the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Scottish Parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes taking place since a generation in the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea by an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates , among the stars of the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new data will help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in star cluster rotate to different rates , as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are with planetary development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star enh@@ ouses , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the Earth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many stars in this cluster of stars , which have emerged some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , they are turning the fastest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at peak rotation rates , these ri@@ pping stars exp@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a star fails , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an identifiable star patch -- like sun@@ spots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest generation of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than less massive stars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , whereas larger stars slow down pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be solid , whereas faster rotor tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; says Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is still much in front of us what we would like to know more about how , When and Why Star S@@ lows down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ j@@ aden rotation rates , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star res@@ ig@@ ns
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his emotional resignation , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es World Series . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2007 , his signature has signed up to $ 27 million annually since 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as advisor and youth coach - at full salary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a player , it paid back to Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es several mil@@ estones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members , H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old may not be accepted in the rest of the bas@@ eball . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - in the field , so controversial is its appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star awarded the &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have taken prohibited ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August 2013 , he was closed to 2@@ 11 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the prime suspect , for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the league could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even his farewell @-@ days , too , are not silent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games received the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Olympics 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ vi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski may not start from Poland in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a true athlete had won almost a medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 metre obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positively tested and excluded from the very beginning of the already critically acclaimed &quot; athle@@ tics competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ch@@ en last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was proven , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court of CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m butterfly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have had to take part in the runs over 50 m of fre@@ est@@ yle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; cited X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the athle@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the report , it should deal with the banned substance around the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported speech to the athlete of the athlete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , about all the wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ loading nation may not participate in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested just like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before starting the athletes , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Association of IA@@ AF has banned the entire Russian team up to an exception of systematic dop@@ ing , even the runner nation of Kenya has produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the swimming sport , the former operations in China also caused severe disputes between the athletes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ les li@@ lac . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of fre@@ est@@ yle , I want to hand over , &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Sun was at the centre of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sun was positively tested in the Chinese Championships in 2014 , but only had to sit down for a three @-@ month lock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
data theft : so per@@ fi@@ de comp@@ resses h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting targeted companies , and are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a recent survey by the malware @-@ defence specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months were at least once more victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 percent of the cas@@ u@@ alties paid willingly by the perpetrators , in order to be able to re@@ use the attacked systems and data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the offen@@ ders special@@ ise in attacks in corporate networks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is significantly higher than for private users . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently observing a frigh@@ tening fast evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2008 , most painting programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the perpetrators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , private users were the goal , but the change to corporate attacks was sc@@ ary quickly over the past few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware is based on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the press pres@@ ser . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to get the end code code to the files , the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ tow@@ ing Bit@@ coin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopped . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware fails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent had even had to inter@@ rupt business activity , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients could be threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : pay not , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an up @-@ to @-@ date study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers have examined the benefits of land and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to get more money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they explain to their victims by means of chat , how they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t example files for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if individuals are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get back their data un@@ encrypted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the potentially high and relatively high risk gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software modular system , to the actual black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the existing malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the black@@ mail is looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we live in a service economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and commissioned another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
payment is made by certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 50 percent of those responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data is no longer a threat to successful sen@@ sing , the perpetrators are threatening to release sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes CEO Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the potential for damage is much higher than before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , the perpetrators could face completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such blocked heat could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the perpetr@@ ator then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ Som@@ e@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of mini@@ vans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the interior materials are well finished and are comfortable , only the top of the cockpit is falling down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l is available for raised and 10@@ 26 l in folded back rests , but the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; are available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ ks and offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m from the ground up to the ceiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the loading height is 650 mm higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine with 88 kW / 120 hp makes the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he should do his job qui@@ eter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is another engine , a 1.5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steering , however , should be somewhat more direct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the tested top version of &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the security systems include the City emergency brake assist ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates , because when sh@@ unting many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant is very reliable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the intelligent template re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and , if necessary , the speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack lie below the arm@@ rest , and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive petrol from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda has a versatile and everyday car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is only conceivable with hazards that are typical of air traffic , the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the carrier had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of disease : when paid the organizer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after their trip , they only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without any doubt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of a trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of its door@@ way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their illness brought the holi@@ day@@ makers back to a defective treatment plant , allegedly polluted by sea@@ water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the family was in the opinion that the trip had been insufficient , and compla@@ ined against the promot@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; indeed , the treatment plant was indeed defective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the organis@@ er only learnt about it before leaving the pla@@ inti@@ ffs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until then , he had to assume that the sea water was fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not hurt his obligation to provide information , so the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in the samples of the water , no im@@ puri@@ ties were found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gious among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the violence perpet@@ rated by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would have been worried about further proposals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and split . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , however , this increases security and strength also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère seeks to implement proposals , up to the Bundestag election 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit order for several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must stand under punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the right of arms to be am@@ ended so that the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last , much discussed duty of sec@@ rec@@ y for doctors is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to search for solutions such as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a glance at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important , however , that the Minister of the Interior clearly expressed itself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban , and the abolition of double nationality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , however , is un@@ constitutional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot prohi@@ bit everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can talk about rules about road traffic , or for witnesses in court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and act of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leadership Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tightening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway bridge
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a regular basis , it st@@ ows on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is to change : the legal regulation is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic on the environmental road every night in traffic jams , when driving over the motorway leading feeder ( A 43 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road construction was extended by 700 meters in the area between Hammer Street and Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers can then slide directly from the hammer road , right on the right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage : traffic divi@@ des early , which improves the total flow of the traffic on the busy road 51 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the track nar@@ rowing on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nerves the mot@@ orists , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on week@@ days , the return sta@@ u reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 , just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from here , the traffic is guided only on a single track via the motorway bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second track had to be rebuilt in a good , three @-@ quarter years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge does not possess the required load capacity , in order to absorb heavy load traffic in particular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated factory day will continue , the competent provincial firm cannot say . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , with years to reck@@ on , the bridge has an official rest @-@ time up to 20@@ 34 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the extension of the legal regulation , the state operation has deliberately selected the traffic weaker times during the school holidays because with disabilities to be counted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday and Wednesday , the traffic will be on the construction site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cross @-@ cultural Travel : cultural offers for schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association N@@ ima provides young people with migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; of the Young Theater Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima , 19 students visited the little house between eleven and 15 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the young people of the class agreed between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and speak little German . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible to follow the course of action nevertheless , the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association N@@ ima is founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; offers for children and families in the theatre play area , theatrical language mediation are in the planning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather has made the shooting stars in the south @-@ west of Germany at night a stroke by the bill , but there is still hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which belong to the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have their names , because they apparently come out of the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
relaxing night : tips to sleep disorders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the evening you roll around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning you can &apos;t think of sleep well before the wake @-@ up ring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is anything but relaxing , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do sleeping problems express or sleep disorders ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and it can be based on various causes , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eps , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Research and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what one can see for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an inhal@@ ing and dor@@ man@@ t disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , many people feel inadequate or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; often , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is common in case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it can be , that different factors op@@ press each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to p@@ addle about everyday problems and worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week , should go to the doctor , let &apos;s talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to allevi@@ ate sleep , it is important to find out about their causes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , has been established in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , one should first contact the doctor in case of sleeping problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can clarify , if the problems have a physical cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , in case of snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , for example snor@@ ing , doctors advise against snor@@ ing or if you cannot find the cause of sleep disorders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after kne@@ eling , one goes to bed at its normal time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are quite a lot of screws , where you can place a better sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it counts on : regular sleeping and standing times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , avoid drinking alcohol and at night do not start to look at the clock - and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming
former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in December 2014 , he first brought gold at the short @-@ ground champi@@ onships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the former DS@@ V athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mate via Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a junk King 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in the swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even look at dop@@ ing as closely or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not say that the controls should be adjusted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported to Germany nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just like that , you should also keep it with countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever cannot be controlled by independent controllers from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of Check@@ ers arrested
professional thi@@ eves at D@@ us@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , the police of Düsseldorf managed to arrest two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a gang , the Tat@@ ars had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civil officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang known to the polic@@ emen from past theft . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed numerous crimes and had been passionate , resour@@ ceful and particularly professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialists of the criminal investig@@ ator 34 can prove to the thi@@ eves who had traveled to Germany for crimes , especially for the Be@@ ast of Cri@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the process , they had caught a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , a few lin@@ den trees in between : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one walks along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the facade of a gray house has someone ugly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , a house with high windows and 13@@ 3 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , however , is preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented rental contracts , on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has been campaig@@ ning for a hard action against the project , the area referred to as &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after having cleared the rooms on the ground floor , the cad@@ ter@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled off the road for three weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers pulled out under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ isers and residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this summer afternoon the street looks peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is here three children , is mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the inhabitants of the housing projects , they share the concern about rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it does not sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police opened between the occup@@ iers and their neighbors , does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which , in comparison to the rest of the city , has a low average and high suspicion of poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 1990 , many houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Mainz street near the Riga . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared by a large police station in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , the district has become increasingly popular for tourists and elec@@ tors from all over the world in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : you can recognize them at thrown slices or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were thrown with coloured bags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one reason why not all of the neighbours might see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important part of the off@@ ences do damage to property , which tend to meet the new@@ builds and newly renovated houses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house beside the disputed 94 in a rented house , there is no question of uncertainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the famous burning cars are no longer available in Riga , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the studied architect , her street is no criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is why it was so important for you to get back to the local people : from the police , politics and the media that all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : through fac@@ eless new@@ builds housed in former building blocks that are displac@@ ing the old residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - people who are not so well be@@ gu@@ iled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not endor@@ se violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should we do , if someone never ce@@ ases ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding of zo@@ omed images : the house projects and the left scene were part of the neighbourhood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub neighborhood that can complain bad about noise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked to not be named with their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ch@@ le is new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the Administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she sees herself as a contact person for all players : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine Client from the working group points to the fact that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there - the ei@@ ghty mil@@ ky sau that has a problem above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ culous but rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; searched for was an administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ghty mil@@ ky sau . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes and networking activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing it for about six weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it has a 50 percent position limited to three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new containers soon stand in the car wash line
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time now , it has been a serious problem finding apartments for connecting flights that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must submit the refugees in their own or hired living spaces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of building , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the responsibility changes from the administrative office , to the municipality and Job@@ center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some time , the search has been very difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , it does not work , so it is necessary to rely on private apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , new containers will soon be installed in the car wash line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but only with apartments , it is not done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to a fixed lead , intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and employment activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fired or furnished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many work in the building yard or help car@@ et@@ akers , do non@@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive side effect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , activity does not mean only work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ ces and Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , I need offers like sports , contact with locals and , above all , language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , administration and honorary titles also jump here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes time and can bridge them time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he couldn &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , could not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; problem cases also exist , says customer honest , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ ver@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a difficult question : did the two previous incidents fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine says quite clearly what some nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something nai@@ ve might call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins bring them up completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , main and volunteers must be on the spot and in the region according to activities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the background , they always have a new impact on refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to answer this question clearly , politics lo@@ oses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on site . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no new refugees , that would relax the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher are already busy working properly to integrate the previous people sensi@@ bly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : looking for intru@@ ders with helicop@@ ters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police helicopter flew off different areas for approximately one hour , un@@ successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the residents surprised the two , and struck the void into the escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ ded pul@@ lis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they fled the city center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the way to the funeral , the police deployed several crew members as well as a police helicopter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the flag was without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the unknown , indeed , fell close to the apartment or their escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police investigating a ro@@ cker attack on Imb@@ iss
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after an attack on an Ul@@ m Imb@@ iss , the police established six susp@@ ects from the ro@@ cker neighborhood due to heavy land peace breaks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of housing searches , evidence and in@@ toxic@@ ation were ensured , the police informed them on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the police , some 20 mas@@ ked men of a ro@@ cking @-@ like group@@ ing threw bottles and stones against the display window of a snack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , they are said to have attacked two guests and have a slightly hurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they fled .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the sn@@ out and the adjacent building there was a damage of 10,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , there is a conflict in the Ul@@ m Ro@@ cker@@ mi@@ lieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thür@@ ingen : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec has come closer to the sales billion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a high demand for medical technology in Asia stimulated sales of Carl Zei@@ ss , Medi@@ tec . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first nine months of the financial year , net sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to 7@@ 9@@ 8.@@ 6 million euros , as the listed company announced on Friday in Jena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Asia business grew dispro@@ portion@@ ately by 17.@@ 1 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to interim results , earnings before interest and taxes increased from 8@@ 9.@@ 5 million euros to EUR 1@@ 10.@@ 5 million . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this financial year , the Jena Medical Group wants to exceed the sales mark of one billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec manufactures equipment and equipment for medical practices and clinics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which belongs to the optical and electronic company Carl Zei@@ ss ( Ober@@ kochen ) , employs about 3000 people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
