<seg id="12">"" "" "" "Ransomware is based on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or Database files as well as for archives of images and videos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "subsequently, the software presents the demands of the press presser." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "in order to get the end code code to the files, the victim must transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryptowing Bitcoin." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "however, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without the production stopped." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware fails." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "22 percent of German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent had even had to interrupt business activity, in one case people were in danger of life." "" "" ""</seg>

"" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons." "" "" ""</seg>
