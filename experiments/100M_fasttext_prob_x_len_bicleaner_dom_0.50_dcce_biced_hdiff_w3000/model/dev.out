Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement , as well as about Teher@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meeting , it should also be the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been tense for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington critici@@ zes the ongoing settlement of Israel , and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the deal signed by Obama around the Iranian nuclear program , the relationship between the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial talk at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly interpreted as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call , Professor , his girlfriend has been shot dead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb , with a slightly itt@@ y voice of the police , told him that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to stress that his &quot; cute dog , &quot; but still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officers found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scrat@@ ched on a white block : &quot; I just wanted to und@@ o it ; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already killed 300 miles to the school where he shot and killed 300 miles to his office according to the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ mark Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Lamb did after that , the fatal emergency call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb Moti@@ v@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students said they were looking forward to his lessons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty consists of 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised the Lamb , said he seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons , and said that he had some health problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , he only taught two online courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , which Lamb had worked so hard for the Lamb , would not guarantee an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant professor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi in Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ sto@@ l in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2009 , Lamb started its work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught geography and education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring , he obtained a doc@@ torate in education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long @-@ standing girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried a few years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , he was the flock of women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lived in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ce , obviously , were together some time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a bath in Gau@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that the dog was al@@ right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but had friends and had a daughter who was 19 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een on his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail took two years ago both in a summer carnival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , they played together the one or the other gig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for different companies online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica games at night in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were at the clear@@ est , and jo@@ king with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was president of his br@@ other@@ hood and the student committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the memorial watch while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and and Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Re@@ be@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police had now said that Lamb had shot the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ um described his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
To@@ ys R Us is planning to hire fewer workers for Christmas time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ ys R Us say that there are not so many Christmas season employees , as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give a chance to the currently employed employees and seasonal workers to work more hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it plan to set 40,000 people in stores and sales centers across the country . in the Christmas period of 2014 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it will start with job interviews this month , and the number of employees from October to December is increasing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business approaches , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shop with employees who sell , send and deliver products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was remarkable for personal reasons , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the film begins , and it comes to my mind that I am a simulated rough and a length of it away with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back for the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time @-@ travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN CEO again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Secretary of State of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , UK and France , to discuss situation in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks of surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start wondering what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nobody says that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts stress that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry@@ th &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups like E@@ b Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps staying power and begin to let their dollar flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey data that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
jumps Any popularity has turned 180 degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a pol@@ l from Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten , they say they have a negative view . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and these figures are , in the early states , in the early states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if E@@ b Bush , the establishment &apos;s favourite , would be the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statement , 52 per cent of the Irish voters tend to believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same number counts in the first pre @-@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 per cent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of ten Independent States say his temper@@ ament was not fit to the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they expose their doctr@@ ines , republi@@ can voters think tr@@ ump for real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when asked who is most likely winning the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten end of July put their money on Je@@ ther Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P voters can regard Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump suggests almost everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some experts point out that the frag@@ mented field is likely to contribute to tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed over more than a dozen of other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a pol@@ l of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the wi@@ dest support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , who support Tr@@ ump , say they have firmly forgiven their votes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course a lot can happen to change that , and no one can truly say , never change the mind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 46 percent said they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say , that they agree with tr@@ ump in the subject of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump named &quot; rape &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immigration and fishing spots in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party , and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so long as the immigration remains in the lim@@ eli@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently will do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fru@@ stration above the government climbs on new limits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by now , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for about half of the support of republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey conducted by ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they are angry at Washington , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa reported two weeks ago that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here in the amateur way , the most expensive flat is located - overlooking the North Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the street , a square meter of a recycling building will cost 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new study shows , in which particular layers a square meter is the most cost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living places , however , one of the price is like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Real Estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ er has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the way , Munich is not at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double Tor@@ ture in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just took a course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a happy hit by Thomas Müller made the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus , then it ran . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a confident kick @-@ off of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern a dream start to Milan &apos;s &quot; Mission Milan , &quot; a dream start in FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League in the Champions League in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and i@@ dol ( 8 . ) deserved with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola will finally take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at his 28th meeting in the Champions League for Bavarian leadership , Müller was awarded to the Bavarian leadership of the Olympic champion Roberto , who had suffered a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they showed a concentrated and committed notion , without shining . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his most recent six home games in the royal class , including prestigious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but with their obvious efforts , however , often resor@@ ting to works . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attacks were often initiated by game storage on the left wing of Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Müller , from the right , had more luck than his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best opportunities in half one had , Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first of all , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then by direct cash , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ed with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Bavaria had used its usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could put a needle stick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but at the door@@ keeper , Manuel Neu@@ er , however , was in@@ let . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , when he directed a shot of Ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat outside initially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero first gave the green light after the final qualifying session , said Sport@@ Director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something else out of it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , and by El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put one on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ all in the stadium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a smaller group of war@@ med Bavaria fans evi@@ dently provoked the supporters of the host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and proceeded with sticks against the Munich followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who smo@@ kes , does not harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam Long @-@ Ter@@ m Study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the good news : with ren@@ unciation , the risk decreases rapidly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among which several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to get the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the scientists had seen more than 3,@@ 300 participants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasizes the authors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the connection between smoking and dental loss goes back to more frequent gum inflamm@@ ations in smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not clari@@ fied , to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk , however , within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing goes back to the level of non @-@ smokers , explan@@ tor Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one must convince people to become non @-@ smokers , explained head of study H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health up to high age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists b@@ ump from late Anti@@ quity to Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings excav@@ ated near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard , said the director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called soil monuments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ology of Natural History . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third section of the Rhin@@ e@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , which belonged to the church . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
young woman of freight train recorded
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a young woman has died at the railway station in the Gei@@ ers@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ ne station , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway platform at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has carried most serious injuries according to the Federal Police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was given a medical treatment on the spot , and was put into a hospital by rescue workers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman , there are no knowledge of the medi@@ ating officers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident could possibly be observed by witnesses , or residents heard acousti@@ cal percep@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by of Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Bri@@ ck@@ yard Range , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critics who give information about the cause of the accident , can be placed at around the clock and given the free hot@@ line of the Federal Police under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
European Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the sharpen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration arrangements for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way corresponds much more traditional dishes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system to which the citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de agreed to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is expected to develop at 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings suggest that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , a second instance is provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would allow it to rise against judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system are not familiar with fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there could , for example , be clari@@ fied between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings requested , especially by large corporations , are regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , breaking down compensation of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiating national laws or establishing a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act designated the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , it has been critic@@ ised that they should not apply for the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German state secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as great progress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel worked with other EU trade ministers in spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against limiting the business of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this deadline is considered to be no longer stable .
delicate folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy acting Fol@@ ks@@ eller recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ pin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is nearly touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells the story of different places , which he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where they were born and what it looks like , in his homeland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens is proving to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs appear harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk of the late six@@ ties but can drift into great opul@@ ent at any time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 US states should be followed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduced , St@@ ev@@ ens appears here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live is enough for him , guitar and ban@@ jo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year later , the musician living in New York comes back to the show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a widely celebrated masterpiece published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts , and is not missing in any yearly list of influential musical media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after highly productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic spare pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this sixth , neat studio album is still orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any effect and rever@@ ber@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle from Ne@@ on head@@ bands and a large lumin@@ escent stage design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens tou@@ red Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburg More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there are now nearly 2000 guests sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly irrit@@ ated St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly fortified album . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience , one hears : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and it is possible to throw off the &quot; record . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only for an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ fully hum@@ bles , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally turns out under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with the prime minister &apos;s question@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions , and for the first time to join David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , with his performance being tested by the media most likely and the Labour MPs from the area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Congress on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the Labour Party &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokesman by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve the top team in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and they are referring to differences in economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acked within Labour , and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements about the position of the European Union and the limit in winning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference , that Labour MEPs set up changes in order to remove the whole idea of a limit in all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hours later Mr Smith said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 pounds to £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , over the last decade across the Dis@@ patch box in the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Labour President , who promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and given him more than 30,000 comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are to be met , and that he will refrain from serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic mini@@ stries , will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he would remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch Theater &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ cture was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

increased Po@@ und Incre@@ ases by Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in parallel , FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the aim of SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2009 , this percentage had been the fastest and yiel@@ ded estimates of the date of an increase in interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % , after tak@@ eover bid of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury items Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - announces growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining giant said he took 2.5 billion $ through a stock sales as part of his strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his app@@ rais@@ al for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , having reported a pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten expansion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the generation of U@@ 17 turns through .

not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , since 7 am the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bi@@ valve construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose Poster res@@ ides in st@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns in half a year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the 10th grade in high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
obligation to attend compulsory school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
Bi@@ eber himself does not .
this has already taken care of .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for publicity in the advertising break of the Super@@ tar , he has collected three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an Anti @-@ Pi@@ per firm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and with every doll , which looks like he and over the counter , Bi@@ eber cas@@ hier too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one is amazed at the window pane . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is said to have exploited more than 100 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ aping too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others stress , Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , does not interest the many zer@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both - and in the Pot@@ ato @-@ Greenland , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ter instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ew@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he accidentally saw on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , there is a barbecue sk@@ ew@@ ed in his shop , sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea has become clear to the Lebanese meanwhile at the Patent Office in Munich , Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much meat and as many potatoes in the sk@@ e@@ wers contains , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with its customers , the culinary international understanding is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cash starts soil resistance campaign to fight against aging
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , Met@@ a tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia , a 700 million dollar al@@ di invasion will be launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
during Al@@ di the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA traders and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough distributed in I@@ GA stores and selling shop@@ keepers who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Met@@ a@@ Sur@@ ge publishes further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy date . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met@@ a &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA network in eastern states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will cover around five per cent of the food market in these two states for twelve months after opening its first markets , but mainly dispos@@ ing of retail stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that I@@ GA retailers might lose 360 $ million per year and Met@@ cash 250 million from the end of 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens up 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and will generate sales of $ 500 million and 600 million in each market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the loss in food and food business and in volumes of a high fixed cost base could cost US $ 13 million from interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Met@@ a loses market share in eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most faithful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s sales and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ a would probably disappear within a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in other words , Met@@ ers refused to publicly react to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s Food and Food Market , accounting for about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt on sales and margins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wholes@@ aler is resist@@ ing however and inv@@ ests more than € 150 million in order to boost sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ avor@@ ites for hundreds of products every week to improve their stores with faster @-@ growing fresh food and provide a better choice of private label food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s chief executive , Ian Mor@@ rice , says that the price adjustments and charging programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious conflict of Kyr@@ gy@@ z with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be dis@@ connected twice by the refer@@ ee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp t@@ abled a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , He@@ aly def@@ ends Kok@@ te@@ ak@@ is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final against Great Britain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a stroke of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too severely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take account of the important decision taken on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Nick gained very quickly what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have made , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary declared the not@@ ary and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all who tried to get illegal into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants drow@@ ned in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people fled from violence for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but fru@@ stration rose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vers over them , the migrants pushed the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian distribution police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some reported back food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must be held in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ nation bloc , at a controversial meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the over@@ shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s migration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put his hopes on a verbal campaign of Brussels or his neighbours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency situation called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having finished a fence at the Serbian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , insisted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in opposition to other EU states , among them Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared Emer@@ gency , &quot; said the spokesman of Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it is very clear : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must still approve the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but journalists from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen difficult armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that the authorities tried 45 people to cross the border , and 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of having crimes according to the new laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , authorities are quick to repair the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungarian officials also included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning , after a train wag@@ gon has arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chaos envel@@ oped the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands remained outside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is now supporting 47 per cent of the democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the pres@@ election . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more than five months before the early elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders sold some winn@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton is holding a huge margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their support in the men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders is only back with 5 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage in the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about half of the Democratic vot@@ er &apos;s voters say they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a quarter would support them with some reservations , and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six percent would not support them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic , especially of her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton , only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic vot@@ er &apos;s voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer republi@@ can voters say this about their prime candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it is time for a woman to become president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Clinton &apos;s supporters , their connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned ( 9 percent ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to deal with the problems and the di@@ sen@@ sel@@ ess are quoted as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the vice @-@ president has a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters will want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is bi@@ ds at the top . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ tons of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice , far from S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton is ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure fell by 78 percent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that appears to be the &quot; most sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors made elections as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maj@@ orities look at Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cutting off hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ ander ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic voters of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ ander , and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since questions about H@@ illary Clinton are still being made use of a personal email address and a server during the term as Foreign Minister , most of the Democratic Ele@@ ctions are content with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinion altogether . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is a different story in the American public , overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; half of Americans are unhappy with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; public opinion was split in March , just after the problem came to light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of them , saying that Clinton &apos;s views have become worse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the elec@@ tors of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 percent of voters do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters are nationwide as well as tr@@ ump rather than honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes at the lead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush cut the best in hon@@ esty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rate of error for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is getting close to Donald Tr@@ ump near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest pol@@ l from C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , half of the support of voters in the new survey has been eliminated , and others lose dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support is growing from 23 % in the latest C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Car@@ son shot up from 6 % to 23 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump , among republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin governor Scott Walker , who died at the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Florida Gover@@ nor Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest pol@@ l is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son is growing in the surveys , with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump , notably before Car@@ son . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking at a Car@@ son rising up last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ask Tr@@ ump &apos;s faith in question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is warm , up to 29 degrees Celsius . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is sufficient for bath@@ ers to present warm water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bath in the north or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure , at a maximum of 17 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people don &apos;t get into the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea share this week , shares the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ er
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost two years after a student died during a student compound in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder lay against five people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a ceremony in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transportation to the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; officials said he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack loaded with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a destination through a frozen section . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , and then he fell unconscious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less , waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the br@@ other@@ hood , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide and set up the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood by Michael Den@@ g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with dul@@ ler force injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year in the ch@@ ic@@ ans , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third degree , for the first five members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with critical attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ other@@ hood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a rate increase comes , and the land@@ se is st@@ acked , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we know this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last , and how long it will stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only little guidance to the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recession came within only 11 months after the first increase in interest , and lasted 86 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so viol@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , however , market participants could determine that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , a look at historical trends is based on how some areas of the economy could respond : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets from 12 to 24 months are stran@@ gled after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study about what has happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more specifically , the market has been in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to interest income , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return in previous six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , with Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle , and the rate of return begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates often promote it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could speed up a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remarkably , gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a price increase of the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only nominal GDP has been below 4.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 % , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and pose the question , &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the year , market participants agreed to an interest in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the session of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade gives only a 25 percent chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all excav@@ ation cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ed heights were set very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks , if they change their strategic course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in bonds , the yields seem to change as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the excav@@ ation cycle , the bond ends immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter bonds , and lead to a down@@ turn in the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cautious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones says that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tightening has expanded , and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in large and large corporations , companies that cover the larger part of their business activities in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and finance their debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond very positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with a weak balance after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity with their shares exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; outside of pure share games , consumers will also benefit from rising Dollar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers can see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary Member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the radio station for its &quot; du@@ b@@ bing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ar@@ gues that , increasingly , he is not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the broadcast The Voice , and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , says a leading member of the Parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private companies do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Euro MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen said that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foolish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also responded to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC @-@ General Director dismissed the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and public education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music , which is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I also think really important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that it had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production that came under fire during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and not particularly striking ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced on special BBC sage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; find a hit from our own stall , &quot; if it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment starts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money in fee bars for other entertainment formats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internet sales rose by the slow@@ est in August , and Black Friday may be responsible for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , there was the lowest result since the record began in 2000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down expenses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales mix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now that happens , and we will possibly experience that growth is less@@ ening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the revenues generated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that buyers are reluct@@ ant to hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buyers from making purchases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that over £ 5 spending was spent a little more than £ 1,@@ 000,000 online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now done via web shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people bu@@ ys clothing and shoes online rather than in the shops in the city cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident , killed - bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the streets of Mec@@ ca , through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Saudi Arabia in part lowers the collapse of the huge Saudi bin Laden group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed , as a crane collap@@ sed at Mec@@ ca &apos;s Grand mosque . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dressed , mostly dressed in white , the route , to cover their respect , when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the funeral procession passed on the Holy Site , where only days before was a building craw@@ ling through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the bed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the family bin Laden on account of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , hung a san@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bodies of 29 priests , who were killed , fell as a crane by the Great Massi@@ mo of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the dead there was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage than the crane fell down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch at the Grand Mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Saudi officials have already confirmed that the h@@ add@@ les will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to come to the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden Group , said that the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an Arab version of the decree , published by the Saudi Press Agency , said that the bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was out@@ law@@ ed abroad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the Grand mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the p@@ addle , which later took place this month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Royal Dec@@ ree also bl@@ amed the group for not current security measures , and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project that is led by the bin Laden Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has been linked with Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family and takes over major construction projects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deceased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a vile son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
officials said that 15@@ 8 people were hospit@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; government officials said that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other injuries will get half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time for cheap eastern European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople is over
British are increasingly busy tra@@ des@@ men says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix stores , which aim to target professional tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Head Cor@@ respon@@ dent of Daily Mail &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is claimed that Br@@ its will lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes for the benefit of the use of qualified East European arti@@ sans who carry out their work at home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; British are increasingly busy working cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the Bau@@ markt @-@ Chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices has now out@@ dated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which focus on professional tra@@ des@@ people and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are met by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment , men out@@ weigh men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our branch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of the five leading companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company occupying exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CF@@ O . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; King@@ F@@ isher announced a decline in half @-@ year earnings and sales , after the group owed the cost of closing the shops . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the Court
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob , on Wednesday , have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abst@@ in@@ ction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the def@@ endants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was legally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the pre @-@ examination that the def@@ endants in the years 2006 to 2011 had money from the accounts they had in their functions for private purposes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he mort@@ ars the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial burdens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fact was eliminated by the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the sake of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not created at any time an asset disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports officials only reck@@ oned up compensation claims and invested the sports club for which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debt - the liabilities amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sch@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the bread@@ crum@@ bs company of the financial staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he decided to take over this task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insur@@ ances as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the detention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed with : you can manage the money freely , only no debt can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the payment of the compensation damage was decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , one part of the allowance was paid only years later , in the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore also package deals and not detailed accounts , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accounts and savings accounts administered the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs have not been disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the financial contribution , it was important to have been the freedom of debt so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in 2011 , against the one functional investigation due to abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that had been set@@ backs , the def@@ endants declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second accused , and according to its statement the association was not known . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on top of that , the respon@@ dent had no answer for a long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he said finally , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if something happened to him , no one would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed him in the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ accused had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim indem@@ n@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why damage compensation ? , judges and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first accused , he said , did not agree with this formulation because the association had never been damaged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never ordered a cent salary , he merely charged o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ eting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accurate information for the early years could not show the def@@ endants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were no longer stored after an audit in which everything was considered correct , they declared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second accused , too , had related o@@ dom@@ eter money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the corrections were carried out in cash , and in addition to that he had to drive from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main trial will be continued on 23 September , with the interro@@ gation of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard reaches more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to staff cuts for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ giant will reduce further jobs in the company &apos;s spl@@ itting up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will save costs in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the step will lead to a special loading of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will rise from the fourth quarter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mining of 5@@ 5,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in exchange , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share was 2.3 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based in Pal@@ o Alto , California , the company is currently growing : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a once again dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers following its services , set the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and do more and more stores immediately online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of some 5@@ 5,000 positions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers on hos@@ ti@@ lities in Iraq would most likely be ref@@ unded : 54 per cent said against it , 35 percent showed up appro@@ v@@ ingly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ operation with Syrian mach@@ in@@ or Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad decreases 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , 29 percent could not decide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as of September 27 , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and electro@@ mobility are at the heart of the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the wide audience can attend the International Motor Show , from Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers of the car association V@@ DA expect to expect approximately 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hungarian police used tear gas at the Serbian border , at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke T@@ rän@@ eng@@ as and water cann@@ ons for several hundred displaced refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the erup@@ tion of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; behind the police , a police line was formed and behind the police a water cann@@ on stood ready . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , the officials initially put pe@@ pper@@ y spray . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the group was dissolved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a pregnant woman , apparently injured , was removed from the zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other refugees s@@ acked in themselves , and suffered from short@@ ness of breath . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police officers of the Serbian police have also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
timing of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the world is watching when the US bank@@ note is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that the F@@ ed would do this , now think that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and keep the interest rates at the current level from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on NU@@ LL . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero @-@ range and start a process of normal@@ ising the interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Head of Staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ cking outlook on global circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that &quot; he couldn &apos;t do it , &quot; said authorities on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he said that he had shot on someone , and someone killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lamb , the staff of the emergency call centre , said that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , and he also mentioned that a &quot; cute dog &quot; is in the house but &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted to und@@ o it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after writing the note , Lamb 300 went to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he eventually took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Excell@@ ent friends &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were her daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a doc@@ torate degree from the Delta State University , as his li@@ festy@@ les apply to the University &apos;s website . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stars , who lost their lucky charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the actor was supposed to fight drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building up the Group
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year alone , with a better organisation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 150 of the world &apos;s 1,000 managers worldwide will cost the restructuring of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the pilot trade union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure , and evalu@@ ates the cheaper ownership of eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of the re@@ orientation is a contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business in future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in future , Mr. Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new order , Spo@@ hr highlights the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group intends to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the conflict conflict with the Pilot Adju@@ st@@ ment Cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court stopped strike this Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was shared by the union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic of talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , the cockpit would be able to achieve sustained results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , the conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilot , background is the &quot; Wings &quot; savings concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa moved to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Morgen@@ suit in the South &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paintings by Le@@ ena Krü@@ ger are visible in the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Finnish , based in Göttingen , has put together a selection of tit@@ ular works for the White Hall of the House , encouraging their viewers to embar@@ k on a journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while this brought the left outer defender to weeping and closing it for at least six months from the game , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute , after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was treated nine minutes in the field , and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later , and then operated in Manchester . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then fantastic plays , and then this happens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he wept .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an el@@ f@@ row@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had been wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that an elf meter and a red card were due . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a sl@@ ump , when Mexico played against Van G@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was travelling in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I could not see the hat@@ ch on Luke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very bad about it , I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also taken to the hospital - after a F@@ oul@@ dering by Chris Sm@@ alling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely , David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t last long before you know it almost . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead re@@ prints a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to enhance the rather short original text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the midst of the walled town of Th@@ ought @-@ Vil@@ le , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , hoping to see a real tree , tru@@ sts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the movie movie , which is arti@@ ficially produced and even the air is a commodity , hopes a young man called T@@ ed to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though he is willing to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron will hear the action of the book so little . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokesperson said , that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election rally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further comments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when one sees the cad@@ res which England has chosen for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not exclude a down@@ fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago but there are good spin players in the batch setup and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear s@@ cars of 2012 just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developing as spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related news : Adam Ly@@ th reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ ons is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are aligned to results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long ago one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he hopefully turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there is another chance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not perform such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the question , how much time a test drummer receives to put his mark , is difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son , before him - , while Nick comp@@ o nine received nine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only Comp@@ ton got the chance to do home and jumping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ ons was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which met us very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends naturally on the assignment in the United Arab Emirates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of suggest@@ ing mos@@ ques alongside Cook , which would yield an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and received four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I did not do anything about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l of cri@@ cket players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County of Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my earlier team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop , before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he immediately made three hundred wheels , and did not look back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t but there is no great number of backup spin players who raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ ding , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes to the white ball phase of the tour , bringing energy and a powerful deployment into the setup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s team mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you must remember that , as with the players , their jobs depend on the results . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
such decisions are not made easy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u , if the economy by 2017 goes into a dol@@ drums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ challenged ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets deeper into trouble with every day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently crushed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at fre@@ ak recently said that some member states , so deeply mired in different crises , as the EU is now and not always out of its own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually don &apos;t want to be satisfied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb up on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants to look outside UK within the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not only with France , &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel has been an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; France &apos;s François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is also a power of bl@@ iss , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Poland soon has a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a lef@@ tist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to imagine that they are getting a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , some such ministers may also intentionally plan not to intentionally comment on the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign will accelerate in 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , and susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a P@@ lei@@ te &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ ian the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the 1975 Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum we supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can remember Boris Johnson , the ore Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ straight ban@@ anas &quot; of Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ foreigners that most of our great newspapers possess . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir really thought about her , but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had turned the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press has never forgiven him , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me friendly cl@@ aps on Monday in Westminster , told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can take but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly , in development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ ungs @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wil@@ dest skir@@ mis@@ hes of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , and what J@@ C told his fellow workers and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whatever the stirring bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the vor@@ tex of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course like Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite Sett@@ lement economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why should Paris or Berlin be wa@@ sting political capital , - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I called on the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims by a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 persons , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et , critic@@ ising the evidence of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely angular basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proving efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to create their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also signed the testim@@ oni@@ als of BA@@ T for Public Health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not provided , but these include several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector finance in the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , he took part in the tobacco management of p@@ he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; signi@@ fies that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the BM@@ J claims were already re@@ acted previously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die annually from a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by identifying current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national independence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BBC should give up E@@ ast@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; former Head of Channel 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as E@@ ast@@ y and The Voice . he said that commercial rival would be &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK stations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC that they are public @-@ law programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time frames against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and tran@@ smit@@ ters like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years at Channel 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sent which would be clearly presented by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to keep the broadcast fee what I think medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least refer to its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes are financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Voice is such a program , E@@ ast@@ y is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am trying to see how this is to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Johnson - an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for the pursuit of reviews &apos; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh published in 2003 that the BBC shows like E@@ ast@@ y should sell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ law niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they fulfill their duties , and they can argue that they have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they put them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course you think everyone , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check their mission to &quot; educ@@ ate , train and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would now be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of her TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful of TV channels will be shown to make everything available online . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment , in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des alter the direction at the moment in which they have sound pulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard , be@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impulses work through the activation of m@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
another topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said that the procedure of one day could replace the depths brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; th@@ read@@ worms do not react normally to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sound waves make the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such as report Nature Communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their m@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when ultras@@ oun@@ ds on modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms where they turn on the changed m@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with the pulse of the light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to light that must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass through un@@ hin@@ dered tissue and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily susp@@ end the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 300 posters are by artists , who have exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel designs in bank@@ sys discretion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped with the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks &quot; which claims &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many artists deal with activists within protest movements to work and notice that they must move outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Am@@ nesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works as a non @-@ profit artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who works for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
V@@ C@@ CP @-@ Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around advertising for the Ce@@ ase@@ fire - by a void of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic ambi@@ valent advertising , but &quot; by the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us to raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is a step in the British government , and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illegal in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the most creative art around the Ce@@ ase@@ fire comes from the area within Excel , where exhibitors exemp@@ li@@ fy fantastic euph@@ em@@ istic products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for life in residence halls
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eleven years ago , I moved as self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense s@@ miles of those whom I upset - and at the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most I have learned , can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ induc@@ ing , up to absolutely terri@@ fying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is temp@@ ting to talk : people tell you where you come from and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you can &apos;t love or hate it because in seri@@ ousness , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
breathe through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and help others to do the same , ask questions and show interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
let people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people often transform into drinks recipes , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people wear and put their under@@ wear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
related : don &apos;t think about starting your university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receives a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room should be a refuge , but many residence halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life long friendship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be hell for someone , trying to recover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away to get the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted , and send him a text message instead of kno@@ cking it down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
apro@@ pos refu@@ elling : do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a guy in my residence halls had the idea that a door not closed , was an invitation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he saw some things .
making friends through che@@ eks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as you start the university at the top of the back man@@ ia , the knock on people &apos;s doors is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; welcome to the neighborhood , I baked something like that , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself , and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , this depends on whether you are an decent b@@ aker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; badly missing l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping sleeping when you tap . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steal food , is a common crime in student homes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances are that they say they are serving themselves , even when they cook inside . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , that &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a washing up to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should not make any noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not just about being an decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl on my floor asked her neighbors whether it makes them something to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and they had a test in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they re@@ acted with even lou@@ der music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they kindly left their neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went to her three hour trial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them and see them again and see them every day and perhaps witness how they all meet together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the heart goes his own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate definitely isn &apos;t your future spouse , try at least to talk a little reason to your under@@ body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exciting moment , in which you notice someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good coup is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by hiding , give a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but shake your possessions at the ceiling no more than twice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single occup@@ ants , low @-@ income ear@@ ners &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of Fran@@ con@@ ia , the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room but also the mother and the ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build a good and good building today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being forced into the housing market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : in a project , he builds town@@ houses for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees are being forced into the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ bert : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; massive housing in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums does not have any sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for people remain a great part here , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ bert : a row of terra@@ ced houses takes the least amount of space .
it facilitates integration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is different , if one teaches people in apartment blocks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much are the costs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ bert : I thoroughly pulled my project out of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly complicated , it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ cl@@ es@@ ha special construction and the parking place regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the cities , there is no place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ bert : there were , who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
which definitely is not right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ bert : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ pulling mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build still cheap and well today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is what it is all about .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ bert ( 44 ) studied micro@@ systems technology in Regensburg , Germany and initially engaged in environmental analyses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS if Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , tap &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; software update . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some have encountered problems after installation , since they get an error message stating that the software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either to wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the phone will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may mean dele@@ tion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps , and then re@@ install apps once the process is complete . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it pays to ensure that your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the load is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t allow the update to be continued , since the phone may turn on half way and could lead to an abor@@ tion of updates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only foreign currency : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second pointed out ahead of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; that I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion ahead of the night race in Singapore on this Sunday by defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far , and won the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2009 and last year , the 30 year old Brit@@ on won the race . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for days , a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Schach@@ club Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who kept herself up for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the German cross @-@ service cross , 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , who accepted Alfred Klein . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , it is possible to record chess players who cannot muster the membership fee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search , too , are to be pushed forward as well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town is seen .
district office seeks direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ Center Anton@@ isti@@ ller have joined together under the man@@ tle of the Social Foundation , and opened a new starting point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides consultations , you can also take part in courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the mountain to the city centre , the social foundation is pulled down from the mountain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , a new district office was opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice for advice on how to care insurance or services for health care providers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for years , we have been using our ambul@@ atory care service to ensure that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ller and the Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; apart from the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment can be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offers from the Senior Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is for Pre@@ vention , Pre@@ vention and Reh@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Senior Centre for Care and Care , &quot; described Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both of the business leaders , particularly in demographic change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , a good de@@ centralized infrastructure is essential in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the club meeting : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ al@@ ising partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the Social Foundation is making a big contribution to ensuring that sen@@ iors are able to live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the meeting of the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg in the eight @-@ year finale of the Bavarian football pitch against the third li@@ gi@@ sts FC Würzburg Ki@@ ckers is now finally termin@@ alized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , October 6 , at the Bam@@ berg Fu@@ ch@@ spark@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday , October 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are glad that we now know when the game goes on stage , now we have planning security , &quot; says F@@ CE team manager Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z Hü@@ mmer , who also points out the advance ticket sales . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our team , it is something special to play against a third party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore hope for numerous spectators , and this is not without reason , because flood lights have a special charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the round of the last 16 teams the FC Ein@@ tra@@ cht Bam@@ berg 2010 attracted 1@@ FC Ober@@ ha@@ id ( 3 : 1 ) and at home against the regional li@@ gi@@ sts 1 . FC Schwein@@ furt 05 ( 3 : 2 ) .

Vienn@@ ese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ years old
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ y@@ ens of Vienn@@ ese architecture , is dead . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he died on September 5th at the age of 92 , like the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus told on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künst@@ l@@ erhaus left an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the twentieth century in Vienna , &quot; as it was called in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; born 1922 in Vienna , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical College in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute for Design . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to establish the Treasury in the Hof@@ burg , Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palace Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intellectu@@ ally , he did not agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meadow dropped the hair in the Bremen city centre , when he saw how a parking space @-@ guard mounted a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meadow pl@@ ung@@ ed from the shop , offen@@ ded the public prosec@@ utor and threw down the fine fin@@ er before the feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still under scrut@@ iny , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fertile soil and the rainforest @-@ typical climate of Is@@ la del R@@ ey are ideally suited for the prosperity of the marijuana plants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three days , the authorities tear down the 4@@ 500 plants and burn them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
men beating 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the group , a 17 year old Afghan , followed by police statements to his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the premises of the petrol station , there were also three persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of these men scre@@ amed the young man , and struck him with his fist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim suffered a nas@@ al leg , and bleeding heavily from the nose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as his two friends r@@ ushed and spoke wei@@ ght@@ fully to the ra@@ cket , he first left his victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from his friends , the wounded young man was brought home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home , and demonstr@@ atively passed over there demonstr@@ atively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you no longer saw the car , the injured person went into the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of a head@@ stock , you apply to the face and th@@ igh of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , only a vag@@ ue activity description is available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters large .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres , and was clothed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asks witnesses and witnesses to report on the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Frank Müller assumes praxis fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the joint Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promotion U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in many places in the country , physicians - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lacking luck : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice field breaks on 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ til@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich will be on hand for his successor in the next few months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who currently completed their specialist training at the Ver@@ den Hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I just called them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , the Müller company liked the idea to practice its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , one agreed that the garbage b@@ ins bought the house with practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hannover , followed by stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , where he was appointed Chief Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz in 2009 and is involved in a voluntary work in the S@@ RK @-@ readiness of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the 19th of September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ t@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to be deposited as house doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms look modern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will offer more ultrasound examinations , as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) , the rub@@ b@@ ish will receive a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; emphasizes Sam@@ nau@@ n mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the practice fields each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another GP practice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ t@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hour , does , by the way , still look in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ bs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors practiced there for 30 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ich recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little melanch@@ oly , she already felt after the long time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the boarding @-@ specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square metre plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always pressed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also taken up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Home Secretary Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is clear that anyone who wants to submit a asylum request can also do this &quot; of course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor via the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue travelling to Austria and Germany , and may also establish corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , however , this Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar did not see in Lai@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia wants to intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister pointed out , Sloven@@ in intends to limit its borders to refugees but not factories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted suicide in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in order to avoid the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby fields of corn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees have ever been meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming days , his country was counting about 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was to encourage people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor will we do this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day further buses would be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the occup@@ ants were on the way all night of the ma@@ z@@ ed@@ onian boar@@ der , which was around 500 kilometres away , through Serbia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary had admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shift in the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary can now be reached a little further west . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic previously stressed that his country , in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , prepared appropriate plans for potential expul@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not give details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; comprehensive options for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you carry out strict controls , in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and the EU partners have consistently supported the country in terms of the standard of border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether the remaining refugees are now going to travel to the Croatian border , it is unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Serbian Minister of Interior N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down the debates about alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not at present deal with very high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ pers suggest migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees in which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bör@@ sen h@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who is accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ ers and PR News@@ wire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der stores should have been made to the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside of our borders are ultimately trapped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the SE@@ C message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this case , the trials against 32 additional charges lasted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the def@@ endants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetrators are to have acted in both the US and Eastern Europe , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you control the two stations of the Mannheim car park , at the pitch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid atten@@ tively drew attention to her twenty @-@ year anniversary with this action , and is entirely confronted with mixed reactions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about life , so we went into action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while some took a Pass@@ ant spontaneously to the chal@@ k and follow the sentence to &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not endure long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; I am not yet &quot; and go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over and over again , little discussions on the action are evolving , about life , dealing with dying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that for me sometime the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband sponsor of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly to the tables , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject of death and death may still be afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the fact that people are opening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an app@@ rais@@ al that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the funeral and funeral atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confronted with the topic of personal experience , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was seeking volunteers , she immediately reported and was there in the year 1995 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her mission and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another war@@ ts , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial support of health insur@@ ers and donations from relatives and associations allows training , training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every two years , training for new employees is offered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boards described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also there , other personal wishes on postcards can be recorded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex results mixed , financial outlook reduced for 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter and the delivery giant lowered his profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company also said that it plans to hire some 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share fell over 2,5 per cent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Cor@@ p. said to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecasts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lower prospect comes in spite of the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January , and despite higher allow@@ ances for body transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company said it nevertheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soli@@ dly yield is achieved by considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans for holiday jobs were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to set 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor forces , for example the same number as last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex ended 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just under the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , previously forec@@ asted by T@@ acks Investment Research analysts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion , respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six of Z@@ acks in@@ quired , analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years F@@ ed@@ Ex has posted a decline in international priority shipping , which posted sales in its Express shipping unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last quarter , sales of land transport rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher operating costs in the freight business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on their most awaited conference in the years , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the gro@@ in for the first time for nearly a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lo@@ oming over them at one end of the second , two @-@ storey sitting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues aim to set the economic interests of the nation , before all other things . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from the congress : maxim@@ izing US occupation and prices here stable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from an unprecedented incentive by the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , the most recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets would be frigh@@ tened to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal bonds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important thing they can observe , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za said , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is going to do , which is uns@@ ett@@ led by the financial market itself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rate of interest this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the strike by promise that a further increase is far away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1,4 % to 16,@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy sustain@@ s the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go far too far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that an interest rate would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would be necessary more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement on the labour market was solid in this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed looks as full employment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives stated that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world collap@@ sed at the end of last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , whereby the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when it is to increase interest rates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of Chinese economy have not occurred in the last few weeks , they would have put on the re@@ ins at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a grip on the effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process technically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years , the influence of the central bank has been enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mere reference of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; close their monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can be expected to supervis@@ e not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for Financial Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jeff@@ rey Sha@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA announced this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not linked with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; varn@@ ishing , a unanim@@ ous member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who uses an interest in interest , adopted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a year later , the F@@ ed representatives rev@@ oked these cuts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis , such as the market demo@@ lition of 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il is not near that level , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to go into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because markets upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until this is changed , I don &apos;t think it should be ahead of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes Chin@@ at@@ own
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the warehouse / warehouse was opened in 1997 , and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious decorations and Christmas decorations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the whole grocery makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) located in this shop is close to the c@@ aries , and has different tak@@ eover options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; products are cheap , and a number of them are sold in large quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the meat counter is extensive , as well as the fish bar - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ e@@ tise the fish and even fry on request for you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owner and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , at the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own park area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even if the shop is well visited , it is not difficult to find a parking lot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees come to Germany , these days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a number of people supporting un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are part of them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even with her 74 l@@ ences , she still likes to teach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in asylum seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the whole of other classes is at a proper school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric association , Rio Grande , promotes nour@@ ishment for healthy breast@@ feeding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to enligh@@ ten women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies , which are painted on breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies need all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , new research indicates that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary supplement that mothers should perform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy nutrition of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the municipality of Bern@@ hardt approved the building permit for the 2,3 million euros expensive sports hall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the planning for the long @-@ awaited turn of the sports complex at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal council meeting , the completed building application has been approved without major discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the committee had , among other things , approved an application for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Exc@@ eption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; semi @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ re first and roof top should be built . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar power plants : &quot; in this way , we get a wonderful southern roof together , &quot; declared mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was about the roof @-@ incl@@ ination , which was supposed to lie below ten degrees for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan was not permissible in terms of roof extension . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the case is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ese .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , some 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tude .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the District Council for testing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital is scheduled to be closed as planned , namely 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes a new medical director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the station , as well as the majority of the staff , moved from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg would continue to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority should be moved to Sch@@ ong@@ au , with fishermen and the further existing inner station . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Wei@@ l@@ heim , the employees who are unable to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the question of who was willing to take over leadership and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au as of 1 October . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the range in &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fisher@@ man is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the next two years , Fischer and his team are expected to lead both houses until next year , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has more than 35 beds , to be shut down in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now , the administrative district planned this for 2018 , when the current renovation is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , compla@@ ined that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , shall in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it continues with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day@@ care psychiat@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what Bes@@ ser@@ es could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said fisher@@ man over the quasi @-@ procession to the Le@@ ch , who was &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house , in which fisher@@ man has been working as chief physician for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleague to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hospital of P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was again threatened by closing in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , the bas@@ kets of the Rhine @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are demanded in the evening ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) at the Berg@@ ische HC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Bundes@@ liga , in Wuppertal , is indeed the clear favourite , but there is no reason for over@@ hau@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past season , the ba@@ it of the Bh@@ c purchased a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jag@@ ni@@ eper , with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two tractor drivers have been severely wounded during their ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the ab@@ err@@ ations on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a shot @-@ off , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was initially unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criminal police were investigating .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who have been missing since Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the youths were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent breach of violence since Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the Prosec@@ ution and the Police on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a suspect , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old prejudi@@ ced on Tuesday evening , according to the legend , and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the cor@@ pse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported on Sunday morning , after having come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a crime was finally found against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the authorities , the interro@@ gation gave the authorities a police interro@@ gation that killed 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and placed the dead in the canal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday to the port fun@@ nel , the investig@@ ators put the burden on him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the immediate circumstances of action , the further investigation is to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns against apartment gap
the situation on the German residential market is tense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are looking for affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German residential market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they compete with income @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built by 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , a study is carried out on behalf of the Association of Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as an asylum seek@@ er in an initial home . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many come across the housing market , and are lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which grows bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently there were some 77@@ ,000 residential units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ins to Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , many professionals lived in large cities in need of living in WG @-@ rooms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a longer time because of the dol@@ drums on the apartment market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve the social housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the basic income tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic income for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be suspended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , attractive tax depreciation is necessary according to the alliance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the support programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the state bank , Kf@@ W , is already well received in cities and municipalities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was already available on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees have a free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Hungary , there is practically no coming through , since more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the North , without hur@@ dles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian inner minister and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the border @-@ off of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees moved to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the previous day , Hungary had sealed its border for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws , which came into force the same day , also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and reach something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they arrived both by bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately after their arrival , they had tried to get to Croatia on foot over the green border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees don &apos;t come across borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the closing date on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws att@@ est to overcoming and damaging the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the condemned , sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday , a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 , at the most important passage R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are among the applicants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees stuck there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; practically , nobody has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers shall be de@@ ported there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees gathered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they collected the tr@@ ash , which thousands of people left the road in the past few weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; barriers were broken down , and one of the host camps in the border region was rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the end , no one wanted to express himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , the country has strengthened its border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , around 20,000 migrants remained in the country according to government declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the morning , the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by instructions from German authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frei@@ lass@@ ing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the border &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy with the vac@@ u@@ ums after the bridge festival on Sunday , when suddenly ten people stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists coming by train to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because Germany had unexpectedly shut the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flow of refugees , Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ ched the rocks together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that , we had the un@@ hoped guests once again , packed with snacks and drinks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have just said , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man did not let him take a generous donation , 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the str@@ anded trains had switched to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening , after the announcement that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany , but still trying to cross the border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regional train was turned on , however , before the border at W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the threshold limit is generally high in the course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday was soci@@ ably soci@@ able on Sundays , organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending thousands of thousands to us now is a logical result of an apparent policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of helping to build structures immediately in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of the national socialism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only those Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with chaotic conditions , are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee must also find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will become a major challenge , given the continued refugee streams and the coming winter to create decent states for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it will be even greater - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad at the search for 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ strong neighbour@@ hoods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the release of refugees , Konrad has to do all the hands full . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christian Konrad , is used to have his word weight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker , to place districts for thousands of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chaos in the first recording centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without a big fuss , said Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , Konrad will reck@@ on with a need of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found within the next few weeks - 20,000 to the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has already conducted conversations with the provincial leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which shall be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator also put on the ORF &quot; Hel@@ ps as we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that stand blank in the winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gers have to comply with a certain amount of the towel holder or size of the duties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , that he is more successful in placing the company , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an elderly gentle@@ man , whom one cannot say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to bear any costs as they stated themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , the own search for districts has not yet been successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment because the people concerned are currently able to refrain from taking these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; criticism ex@@ erts the head of the city to the division of refugees within the federal state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , too , other areas have to make their contribution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) has recorded further proceedings in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not un@@ sealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic continues to be possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is now the appropriate border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer be available . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prot@@ ectors , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria , too , leads to its borders again , is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in Linz &apos;s industrial line , is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he can imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on to acquire them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is rented by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres remaining space in the building are already rented , for further 40 percent there are requests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin once opened the second business in the Arctic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focal point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ ar@@ cade : after all , it now has grown in the form of another business local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the store , in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Great Hall of Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has given birth to her mother in the cra@@ dle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like the most , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why so many women looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag into rap@@ ture , the professional woman cannot answer with the latest security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps , it is because a beautiful bag util@@ ises every outfit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are named investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this feature also communic@@ ates with the billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether or not he reveals himself to foreign affairs , journalists or gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics - the applicant for the US presidential office has stir@@ red up the election campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker , with a fo@@ al fres@@ co , is a concept for many in the village of Win@@ zer@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them , in the 1200 inhabitants , are over ei@@ ghty corners related to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in Pf@@ alz : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the all@@ rounder Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous shoots , to which beside Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz belongs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to say that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the king of hearts , he has not brought it there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tr@@ ump is a bit &apos; a big mouth &apos; , Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dently loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt around , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the licens@@ or , says she . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , Tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the foundation stone of the real estate group was the first shopping in New York .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the movie start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in contrast , this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it is pol@@ ated , this is not so like@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement is rather dist@@ ancing the American , &quot; he is always so ro@@ aring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ which was generally good anch@@ oring .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as a president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes will also be ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wend@@ els film , which has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ as , also in the US the interest awak@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain clim@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the village of 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; may have a maximum of 2,500 residents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have not been any major shifts in the review for Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the breakfast show of N@@ ine was aired by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull achieved the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programmes to which Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n belonged . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this down@@ side of the insurrection seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers among the five major cities , compared to today Today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , in August Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in September , Sun@@ rise stands at 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Karl and Lisa are ok , thank you for checking ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Re@@ be@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe achieved an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia generated 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decline in the Qu@@ otes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars , which made it impossible to over@@ ride the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally published as &apos; Sun@@ rise , Today Today remains locally &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last three agree : Bachelor of Sam Wood is the perfect man , but who will he choose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
secret revealed ? ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have unknow@@ ingly clearly who wins The Bachelor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the woman , at Sam Wood , finally landed in The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one , who has received the last Rose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on fel@@ lows on the day before coming out of three two , you might have accidentally given a hint about who will be the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all three women have ly@@ rical reasons why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; could their answers become a spo@@ iler who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both quickly , except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies noticed that they were pretty compatible , and I thought it was quite compatible with the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sarah stands with both feet on the ground , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and when she was asked whom Wood had to choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bachelor will be scre@@ ened on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a , and it looks like a wise decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some trainers used Hay@@ ne to ban@@ ish the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ key as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return , and also in the running game following a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a also openly strengthened himself in his press conference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ atz@@ ed catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a punch that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL debut . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut in 2007 , when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans , holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss rights of gay rights
Mik@@ hail K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky , Russia &apos;s weal@@ thi@@ est man was arrested on a Siber@@ ian tur@@ f with arms authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after openly challenged President Vladimir Putin , K@@ ho@@ dor@@ kov@@ sky compla@@ ined that his oil company Yu@@ kos was seized and his democratic endea@@ vors failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the high number of refugees , the Free voters are calling for the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Acc@@ ur in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get block@@ ages in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friday , Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , quite different main themes were provided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters &quot; meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will transfer the exam , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as there was during Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the 1990s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not going on , we have to address the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the Administr@@ ative Cour@@ ts , who are responsible for asylum complaints : &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W manager critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bayern does not push others away . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the state policy in large wall@@ ets should not fall under the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a long @-@ standing long @-@ term torch remains on the agenda : education policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new school year , Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; with an extension of the secondary school from three to four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the gym@@ nasi@@ ums that we want . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

tight Wall Street helps Da@@ x on jumps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a long @-@ distance , German stock market closed the tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing and nervous trading process with threads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only in the afternoon there was a clear start of the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which led down the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tec@@ Da@@ x , technology @-@ elastic , rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 , as the lead index of the euro area , fell by 1.9 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in London and Paris , trade associations also booked solid earnings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ s@@ ans count on the markets , until after the interest @-@ winning decision in the US , and also to the great decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the debate on the loads from nuclear descent has temporarily pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low , and also left deep marks on E@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German energy companies may need 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the press , the German government has denied the numbers cited in the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest energy companies recovered , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Da@@ x @-@ tip , Infin@@ eon @-@ shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US publishing magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , investors presented a little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , investment in promising waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; car values were required : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were dropped than in the same period of the previous year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the papers from the Daimler and BMW Motor@@ show increased by 1,@@ 34 percent or 2,@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen activities increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the German pension market , the exchange rate of listed German securities dropped to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the afternoon , the euro &apos;s course fell to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against mid@@ day , the European Central Bank set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the dollar cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ ges in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ hak@@ al , leading district officials , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr D@@ hak@@ al said , the police used tear gas and fired into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber floors , known to which they can kill , which are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conflict was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , which are formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , dividing the country into provinces is an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been centrally governed by centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legisl@@ atures have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Treaty in Kathmandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; construction site in the city , planned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the property at the Em@@ der Jugend@@ zentrum Alte Post is to be built again , again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of 4,000 square meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned . however , concrete offers do not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 sq@@ .@@ m. plot in direct proximity to the Old Post &apos;s youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is planned to use the area for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which investor would come into question , is not yet clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , already purchased several months ago and the building can be disman@@ tled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning for the holiday settlement at the Small sea near Em@@ den take shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , the investor presented public plans for the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several An@@ gli@@ ders are still worried about - they fear the sale of their free travel agency
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , behind closed doors had been negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the plans for a new holiday resort at the little sea near Em@@ den are on the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Inter@@ est , medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ der Council . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which appealed to the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger went on the offensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for months , the project has been in discussion for about ten to twelve million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pictures and new details were sum@@ mon@@ ed to the desired hotel building , which had come to the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member at the advoc@@ acy group of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus@@ loads must come so that it pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , what happens on the good one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google starts dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign , which aims to help thousands of refugees who have rolled over the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of the donation appeal , on its blog . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of letting a manager ask the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud wrote a Google employee who escaped with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old about her personal experiences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Google said that the first global funds raised up to $ 5.5 million can be doubled to $ 11 million in goo@@ gle@@ .com / &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ear@@ th@@ eli@@ ef &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many also fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for slightly overweight diab@@ etics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advantages of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people , type 2 diabetes , can take at least five years after a new study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote a guide to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the years , obesity operations have proven efficient in type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; BM@@ I , a certain measure of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital have collected data collected since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c secre@@ tion - for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments around the age of 29 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes disease was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % partially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent , and partly in only about two percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , &quot; the authors found out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept at 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in the medical treatment group , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as you reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the research team also toler@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and rather reported a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while the new study reveals no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people undergoing obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of dying or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have strongly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ck
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a theme that is widely noticed in the literature : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rü@@ ck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the full @-@ time author has grown up in Lang@@ weiler , and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama said and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to stop violence in the home countries of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that , under the circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama thank@@ ed Germany and Austria efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and issued out that the violent reaction of the US with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to resolve this issue is non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of taking of disinf@@ ect@@ ant drugs by children over the past 4 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic anti @-@ infection agents , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 were reported to report 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that some children are intentionally drinking disinf@@ ect@@ ants , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
videos on YouTube indicate how young people drink dis@@ infection only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are fragran@@ ced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very appealing for children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation especially in small children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control center at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant hand@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally deemed to be drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated her at the winn@@ ings Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah sl@@ ammed their words and was unable to go when they arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen off the alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained toxic , non @-@ declared ingredients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an active ingredient . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in January three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York were planning to poison their &quot; gem@@ ental &quot; teacher by laying out anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , so it reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant agents and ban@@ ished them out of their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a rear @-@ end collision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and on Her@@ es , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old lor@@ ry driver travelled to the round@@ about in the direction of the round@@ about industrial area , and it was too late to notice that two previous vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and postpon@@ ed this vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police took part in the accident involving vehicles of about 10,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready , and had to be tow@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rum@@ ors for smells : no di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Griff@@ i@@ ths is playing the talk of D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Glasgow , Dei@@ la says that the ho@@ ops stand on a bad place , but that he will turn it again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts will be fighting for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s accus@@ ation and war@@ bur@@ ton to be war@@ y of January new commitments that could destroy the Ka@@ ders &quot; unity
D@@ ons increase lead over Celtic to five points
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first half @-@ time Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter gave Aber@@ deen a close victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e , so that the D@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays the talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ ie at Celtic Connec@@ tions , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates are not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think we feel pressure , I think that the players are looking forward to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is bored of Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers @-@ Middle @-@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic so there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they talk about both teams , and that &apos;s what they are interested in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will turn around things , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ à has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ men from Aber@@ deen , which now stand at the top of the table with five points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we feel that exactly like that , but we have to go on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really need to really support Celtic , because that makes the player better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , to be together is so important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ bur@@ ton war@@ y of January transfers
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite his comments , just a few weeks ago , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cautious when signing new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the players who come in summer , have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group during this season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team is really good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the Transfer period in conversation , indicated that he could withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a annoying nu@@ ck@@ les for two years , and has not managed to finish Wales this summer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hear@@ ts posted on S@@ FA &apos;s Battle for N@@ eil@@ sons comments
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Hear@@ ts ran 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent from the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red card of the defender was later rev@@ oked - the third red card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and persi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le
the in@@ cor@@ rigi@@ ble bee was corrected after he promised to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident happened in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn , Edinburgh , in front of Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le , March 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; it &apos;s safe to say that I don &apos;t return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team , but stands for the decline in the playing field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will bring the boys back to Tra@@ b , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es happy to win against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory that offered them a margin of five points before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while it increases in the UK overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom rose from 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ONS ) showed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision , to remain part of the United Kingdom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
dr@@ unken bother@@ ed the course
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the security staff was unable to bring peace , the staff called the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with the use of pepper spray , the officials could put the stur@@ geon in custody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses during his death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the day approached , I began to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as often more applications are available than places available , a flaw@@ less lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who will be chosen , will watch it emotion@@ less . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the course of the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality , on Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I compla@@ ined about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; form@@ ulate it better , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said , and wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , I do not want to go into all the details . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I believe that a strong likel@@ ihood is , that he is not guilty of murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe , that his execution is wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and from this perspective , I will see him die . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot claim to be really objective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there will be other re@@ porters , to which you can turn to it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man after a humid police chase , persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry , when he over@@ came the man from the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the attempt of a man from Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer , trying to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale called for a house peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape to C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said &quot; I do not come out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people are doing funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Moo@@ dy asser@@ ts that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Moo@@ dy asser@@ ts that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year , threatening to finish the race immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment - the last straw on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what was best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t @-@ up@@ shot test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he could not explain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been sitting on it for a long time but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; says Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I have said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I do my best for them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to think about what I &apos;m doing with my license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had announced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ers that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man whom I would name when I was asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you seem to believe , that I am a dec@@ eiver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed to seize me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , Chairman of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should this bring me to the view , that it will be personal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has the R@@ V@@ L a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude , and perhaps it makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe people think out there , that I am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they now think about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching caused him to &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the beaten Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the rac@@ es@@ days treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing sports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my staff wrong@@ ly applied mud on my leg .
it could have been so last night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it had , however , on the race day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; says Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested for driver &apos;s flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cursed in Cob@@ ram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said , the mot@@ orists continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is expected to be charged with assistance and assistance , due to other traffic off@@ ences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in the hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism of his players as &quot; Agenda setting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the Storm player &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high @-@ stroke victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a short note to the Storm team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s fli@@ cker , and said they were concentrating only on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches to his team is confident , as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm Team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is funny , as it always appears at this time of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ ett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of a sh@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as thrilling , especially his young players at their speed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all its kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like these . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game Storm vs R@@ oo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos , against cow@@ boys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the playing of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or are breaks , and no points something exciting ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , it &apos;s the game boards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they mention , it means that we will meet them in a phase . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Storm Team was free at this weekend because they won the right to either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail for drug abuse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man who could potentially have a life sentence for his attempt to get possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released on a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and launched in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the Marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that he tried to possess the whole amount and that he could have been in the café from a harmless cause . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the Court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve his release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the secret statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to prevent it from appearing , he warned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ated his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police daily and stopped at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab apart
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of a rear @-@ end vehicle with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two of the three trucks participating had been bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site , in the direction of Basel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third driver observed it too late and tried in vain to turn left to the left at the last moment , as the police announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is torn apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours , until 2 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to attract ped@@ ophi@@ es to the sending of pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children that were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately alarm her mother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the five pictures , then analyzed the computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches used to search for inappropriate images of children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then Ho@@ gg claimed to have done it as it would have done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ es on the internet , &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were done by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , and he asked him to send more photos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone , and confronted the accused with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls , who looked much younger than he . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment of in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year and did not appear before the court on 24 March this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual offen@@ ders , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October in order to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit in this case , but was kept in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was added before the date of judgment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
dam@@ s devi@@ ate to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are being taken up from the large control points at the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many hau@@ sts left people from fear of discovery and arrest , increasing the number of people in smaller border cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokesman for the German police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1,000 refugees have been taken up in the coun@@ ties Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they had reached the German side , walking over bridges and dam@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there , they are taken to the reception by Federal Police and forwarded to the registration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , more refugees arrived on Wednesday at the Munich Central Station on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 700 people arrived in the capital city alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokesman said in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stuttgart : a for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against a storm in the south @-@ west of wed@@ n@@ esday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot marine air currently streams into the country , the German weather service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart divided . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low was the footh@@ ills of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic Ocean over the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected , above all , in Baden . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ seek@@ er with bows from 60 to 90 mph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd makes it : every two years , the car@@ makers at the IAA show their new products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cars from the compact category are currently in demand : approximately 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is reflected in the International Motor Show ( IAA ) , September 17 to 27 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the greatest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available for dealers in autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann pointed out at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Opel presents a start @-@ up below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current Astra costs from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the Hessen offers additional diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door model . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comb@@ i , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively available as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and sporty GT version . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the trade he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new model , the Nissan feeder plans to find its position in the strongly growing segment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the basic model will get a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbo engine and a power of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s indications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 compact model that can be seen at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put on hand in front of the front panel : the radiator grill was re@@ painted and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the ris@@ ky Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee to the prison camp of Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their dignity , prisoners generally claim financial compensation as they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court decided this decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judges , they can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated in a single cell with around five square metres floor space between June and November 2009 , and the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after that , the man , who was now on the free foot after his lawyer , had been transferred to a larger cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his arrest warrant , due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin , failed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Constitutional Court over@@ took the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Commerce and rejected the case back again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although for legal reasons , for legal reasons only a few days of detention for compensation were decisive , a compensation was given . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be to fear a mi@@ sting of the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber of Commerce has to clarify the amount of money compensation now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , the Constitutional Court has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April , because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of 2011 , a decision of 2011 also shows the multiple occup@@ ancy of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , on Wednesday he also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , a decent housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for three months , the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged in a similar cell between 15 and 21 hours a day as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prisoners are therefore repeatedly included 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to massac@@ res it should have come because of the tense situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the judicial pres@@ idency , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to the lack of young people , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what &apos;s Happ@@ ening to Germany ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to statements by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to record one million refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated a determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can create this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is coming to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to different forecasts between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually , over the next five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects : yearly 60@@ 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing are out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favorable apartments will also apply for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Minister for Building Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing needs to arise annually , and the Federal Government would have to invest a subsi@@ dy of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , scientists and the Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to estimates of the Institute for Labour Market and Vo@@ c@@ ational Research , it is estimated that 55 percent of the poultry farmers in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualification to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission company , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ ration@@ alist Dietrich Thr@@ es@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there was a political change according to the Thr@@ es@@ hold : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while there was a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as does the residence obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view is that refugees should be allowed more quickly to access the labour market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is lack of German knowledge to access the labour market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , there is no adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , studies show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the opinion of Thr@@ es@@ hardt , the creation of networks is the royal path for labour integration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ bar , speaker for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should the need for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialised schools . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the countries , students without German skills are prepared in classes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have qualifications in German as a second language . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ains from the Berlin School of Education . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk also estimates that about 20 per cent of refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle no federal asylum seekers or inde@@ b@@ ted the study , the only exception was Berlin , Interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; students willing to study could be facilit@@ ated access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after asylum seekers , refugees with a post @-@ asylum claim do not receive any benefits if they start studying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter generally do not receive a b@@ ump@@ y , since they do not fall under the circle of entitled persons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees had to live four years in Germany to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g eligible , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this breakdown to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
students should immediately get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many people religion is an important part of their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state should gradually clear the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state churches law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic benefit association , who takes care of the newcom@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the right , duties are also duties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism is also part of this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried in to Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to train such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Ba@@ yr@@ ische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the future , integration will be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and the interests of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and why international agreements such as the Anti @-@ rac@@ ist Convention Germany undertake must become reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Germany would be able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , the president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacity , we manage this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , additional money has to flow into the system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to the registration health cards immediately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , achievements could be expected with the federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the application of asylum seekers sees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , doctors will mainly make language barriers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are worse informed about their diseases than other patients . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only in hospitals , also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be covered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many refugees , however , would be helped by more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in refugee camps , for example , there are clearly more un@@ attended disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV clarification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the partly other clinical pictures , German doctors come from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the federal psych@@ otherap@@ ist &apos;s chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that each fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic Stress Dis@@ order suffers from so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with breath@@ lessness , di@@ zz@@ iness , pal@@ pit@@ ations , and fears of death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe terr@@ ors and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to prevent the symptoms chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to now , only four percent of the psych@@ ically sick refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although psych@@ ically ill asylum seekers in the social welfare offices can apply for a psych@@ otherapy , it usually takes several months . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in the social welfare offices , experts or physicians , who are not trained for the psychological conditions , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst uses the tradition of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal is to draw any age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst is inviting you to dream in the Man@@ ege on a tile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , veter@@ an teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion , &quot; under this motto is the current stage of performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for more than 33 years , the Cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the gift to the lovers is in the blood of the family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to bring people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cosm@@ opol@@ itan with cosm@@ opol@@ itan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cir@@ cus program convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; excell@@ ently at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wit and charm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , it wants to easily record the Cuban duo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ease and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to capture women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides numerous salmon salt , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with its finger@@ tip and articul@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics , like little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approximately 80 animals from five different continents , enjoy each string unit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes of each wish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animal does not feel comfortable , nor does it want to go into the arena . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so , the top priority is : good for the animals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially for her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ te , the family of Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the two animals lived together for eight years , and nothing happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the nests , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for every visitor , this should be something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if 5 or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from 17 to 20 September , Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst requested his performances daily from 17 to 20 September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the animal garden is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds false speech in parliament
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by claims by members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month , they ki@@ cked him out and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the speaker of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said seven opposition politicians have received text messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but she has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members that immunity in the Parliament ends , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job cuts result in a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP stated in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses supporting companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing previously uns@@ ur@@ passed , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company &apos;s explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electro @-@ equipment and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mic@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ers must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb , behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger emphasized to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September , and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to his old swing during the pre @-@ season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a bone , which does not heal well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not in touch with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries he had before . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also develops an unpleasant pattern , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd records 23 different Wil@@ sh@@ ere diseases since his debut six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded the most vulnerable days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement will continue during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat power , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I &apos;m confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arsen@@ al launches its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the play against Chelsea on Saturday and Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger will set up a rotation within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow players who need it to give a little break . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to advance by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the largest influ@@ x of in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where it was measured on the Richter scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , it was 10th in Zagreb . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains committed to his management to lead the association to his first European apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has never worked , in the case of arsen@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration : the comedy show that gave us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lack of similar shows in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now has become more doub@@ t@@ ful than ever before , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it is three times more common in men than women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an effort to address the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ Operator ( Cal@@ m Campa@@ ign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) 2015 announced the goal of asking the men to seek help if they need them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation predomin@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ cally values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much more deeply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and like a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focus was placed on the head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gle@@ aned by the interaction as a friend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequently hu@@ gs , moments when football boots in cosy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can relate to each case , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a telephone counsel@@ or employee , I explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ risk showed me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; has a tremendous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly shows the little moments of male @-@ friend@@ ships .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as much as my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status can also help people in moments of desper@@ ation , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or , even better when you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .

di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to crush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating his hits against Malm@@ ö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , di Maria meets PS@@ G passing by Malm@@ ö . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ u@@ ts as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master along the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball at the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Real Madrid and Sha@@ k@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris takes a strong start against Swedish champi@@ ons , as they do not only aim for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but while they got the points it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ v &apos;s missed chances in front of the gate . he was later changed in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with whom he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to gain 2 : 0 to look back on our opponents even if there are certain things that we need to perfect over the season , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team that held a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place opposed to Bordeaux in the First League but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing storm was designated as the man who was taken over to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United and he indicated why when he ended up in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malm@@ ö defence before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and &apos;s long corner of the network .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö , the Celtic hit in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and played a serious opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but except a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed by Kevin &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes arose , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was p@@ atz@@ ed alone in the first half alone and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after rest@@ art@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ d@@ movi@@ c who was led by Wil@@ land in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the post ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win in the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that ended all thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the qualification matches are not sufficient . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Switzerland , the mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is affected by mining raw materials prices , collected $ 2.5 billion by a stock sales as part of its huge debt settlement plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core company , registered in London , said in an explanation that it sold new shares valued at about 1.6 billion pounds to pay off its own debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn pus@@ hes the demand and is wre@@ aking ha@@ vo@@ c on markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early Wednesday morning trade , the issue of rights of reference brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last week , Gl@@ en@@ core announced the 2.5 billion $ stock sale as part of the more comprehensive plan to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were 1,3 billion shares valued at up to 9.@@ 99 per cent of the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
refugees arrive in Weimar
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday morning , 49 people reach the city administration in Weimar after a long run . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ oultry come from Syria , Albania , Afghanistan , Macedonia and Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latest addition is a six month old girl from Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House confirms X@@ i Jin@@ p@@ ings visit in Washington
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , the White House confirmed in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and returns to Beijing &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US president and First Lady Michelle Obama will also be host of X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have conducted bilateral discussions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to expand the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a series of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but also to address President Obama and President X@@ i to construc@@ tively address issues of dis@@ agreements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; XI , whose visit was announced initially in February , is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of controversial questions , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber@@ spi@@ on@@ age in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
440 @-@ PS sports@@ car borrow@@ ed and driven to scrap
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 29 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to meet a dream , and gave himself a Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the rain @-@ wet highway , the evil awak@@ enings came . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a company in the Got@@ ha district , one can fulfill the dream and rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mu@@ st@@ ang boss 30@@ 2 with 440 hp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so this did a 29 @-@ year @-@ old from the Got@@ ha district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the A 71 near Arn@@ stadt , the dream was then gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 29 @-@ year @-@ old lost control of the sports car , fell on wet road@@ way into the sk@@ id@@ ling and drove to the guard rails . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sports car suffered total damage , no one was injured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the damage is estimated to 40,000 EUR . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times the Champions League winner , two time World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he stood before the European Championship before leaving Barcelona . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything back then , we don &apos;t know , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the registered FC Bayern , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rou@@ man@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the change , however , did not come about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the decisive man for this , today works for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I played a great European championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matt Dam@@ on met the Af@@ ro@@ ameri@@ can film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said , she will not be needed behind the scenes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown under@@ mined the need for alternative perspectives and in relation to a black protag@@ onist in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , do it with the filling of the film and not at the filling of the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . &quot; okay , &quot; as the comment@@ ators of The Mar@@ tian captiv@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only black person , and she is an ut@@ te , beaten by her white dress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the producer of De@@ ar White People opted for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the discussion was aired , social media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ on &apos;s comments before dis@@ approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ vers and 4,000 kes since its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officer , the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter achieved nationwide action and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to address discrimin@@ atory practices against color content . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album stand@@ still , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ning first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and ease of use Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first Ath@@ lete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced an competition participant , who completed all stages of its obstacle course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the final task , climbing was one of the 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of 1 million $ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; Isaac E said ! about his pil@@ es of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly .. as I can imagine , how it is ... the future is unknown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changing life , he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any res@@ ent@@ ment about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received a lot of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think Isaac would have felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the filming will start in spring 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ wins donated a chance to climb within a game of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Stam@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support when Detroit pun@@ ctu@@ ated three times in the first two cour@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside , and allowed three R@@ uns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to stop this year , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to throw every game at the bull@@ pen , and therefore I want to go in the game completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nomin@@ ee Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done the slaughter well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen and he brought it straight into the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with three wheels at the back of the seventh ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
Right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon made his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ dy covered the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the nomin@@ ee R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a Two @-@ Run escape . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run , Ver@@ hagen made the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the 27th time leading in the major league in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ring , Wall came a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the tiger Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right @-@ handed one , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the start of the game , Detroit benefited from an even un@@ event@@ ful Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two cour@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled earlier than a month because of a back @-@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously not the beginning I wished , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ dle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , creating a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , but managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tig@@ ers settled in the second one , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE 3 @-@ 0 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he hasn &apos;t hit very well , but he has caught the right place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever right handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four strokes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remarks : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throwing training .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the San@@ che@@ z &apos; shoulder in 2007 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the list of injuries because of a shoulder block , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris goes from the list of injuries to start against the T@@ wins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30 , 2005 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 20 August , he has been missing because of a distortion in the right hip joint . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will finish their series of three games at the target field on Wednesday
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hundreds of refugees should perish in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people who were there should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden did on Tuesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was estimated that the refugees expected 450 to 750 refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few days , several sport halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily lower there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are then to be spread to other municipalities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen after details of the government pres@@ iding pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt and Han@@ au , too , have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ischgl : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the director of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he rejected the European states &quot; collective behaviour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years ago , we had been glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce had passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Austrian Interior Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , announced on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF ( ORF ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too , did not send refugees back to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s so agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she stated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said there were already discussions between the Director General for Public Security and Represent@@ atives in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concrete figures were not mentioned , and referred to conversations held on Wednesday in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come across the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sunday , Germany had begun with temporary border controls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far been able to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee movement in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the first recording and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the Länder , and announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined the people who needed protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have no lead @-@ perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this view was strongly divided in the round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chancellor emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole must now deal with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck on the Balkan Route . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday , Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania could be rub@@ bed with a fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence in Hungary .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first arrested people , who had cut the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Turkey , tens of thousands of migrants reported on the way to the Greek border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn , En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sp@@ urs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these include researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the moon is easily deceived on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although this movement is small but too big for a permanent sky body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even longer , it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes in 2006 at the South Pole of Saturn , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama in 1860 München several weeks
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1860 München must abst@@ ain from Rev@@ en@@ ue Val@@ det R@@ ama for about one month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation carried out an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury in the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is scheduled for four weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a serious loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential obligation of a professional professional . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium , and previously stood under contract with V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team again next week . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian National Player shall enter the running training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ok@@ ot@@ ie had injured himself in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , at a violent cl@@ ash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , those who want to look for its slim line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar , especially sac@@ char@@ ose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them B vitamins and vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ goes but a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when purchasing man@@ gos , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too solid and pleasant to smell . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so , also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should be stored at room temperature , and consumed within a few days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet foods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney sp@@ ends well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US package service U@@ PS uses up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS announced on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 volunteers for the holiday season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex met previously in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh cri@@ tique of the package services . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first fo@@ eh@@ ement rush and then marked cold front
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn enters the valleys of the F@@ öhn wind , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland split on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday and in the night on Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows partly with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ement valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after fo@@ eh@@ ement on Thursday morning , we cross a marked cold front that brings heavy rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest @-@ current . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the north side of the Alps , in the night , the F@@ öhn blows through the valleys . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ ouses with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with more than 100 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ öhn can advance to the adjacent center of the centre , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while in the north on Wednesday , F@@ öhn blows for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the Alpine slope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here , rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be calculated in the next 48 hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday morning the hair dri@@ es out , as a result , a cold front rolled with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; along with the cold front , the wind is refreshing to stor@@ my , and temperatures are going back significantly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the following days are north @-@ west with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther place
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German reform@@ ist on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the park is located in the middle of the old Rome , next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches , in Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , remembered that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in hiding their faith over the centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a symbolic way , the pla@@ za becomes visible that the tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ iner , around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , he felt the city as a welcome messenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to historians , his negative impressions might have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , with his thes@@ es , Luther had initiated the division of the Oc@@ ci@@ dent church with his thes@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hammer artist spent three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works , which Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , the Word was ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with splendid images . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which has formulated its own personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 designs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the contrary , it can be quite dark . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a sub@@ jec@@ tively @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ hood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his emphasis on art books . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who was based on painting with the respective Bible points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bibli@@ cal points selected by Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into the present context . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these texts , like verbal mirrors , are painted by Al@@ ts painting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , he formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old doubles a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing was already done with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I tried to work on that to bear myself again with the Lord &apos;s father again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his second request is to bring art to greater significance in the fastest time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perception of image worlds is now characterised by publicity , and that is loud . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
symbol@@ ism is suppressed .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewers fall into the images , let them look , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like him to understand life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t pay attention to recording the Bible completely , but also chosen the mysterious themes that were important for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the images , the text only explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love , and that of responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas models - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
construction start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn is near
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to mod@@ ulate ground level for a round course : one year later , almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fessions in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ones , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so hill slo@@ ped , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in October , permission was given to Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there should be no further &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga sets a clear mark on the weekend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football re@@ acts to the p@@ aired situation in Germany and helps politicians to cope with the problems that arise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that doesn &apos;t bother me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the State Minister Mrs. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football , and wants to help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive points must be the policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , the German Football Association has expanded its &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; Refu@@ gee Initiative for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared K@@ ren@@ al bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , some federal lists support this program . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals set a clear sign when they will bear the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor @-@ logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ k@@ ens Sport@@ head Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is about everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our jet force , our influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Ret@@ tig , Managing Director of H@@ offen@@ heim , spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the league . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this Friday , the National Team of Women loads 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ id@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big community work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places , be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equally great is that small and small clubs are active , too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this year and next year , the Association will share 300@@ ,000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported K@@ id@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO lost an eye in case of an accident
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a down@@ fall in early July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a glass glass after midnight , which he had carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , impot@@ ent , then tow@@ ed out to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP co @-@ founder of Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t normally comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; said the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important is to stand up again when you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except skir@@ mish ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury , when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also comes as a reserv@@ ist for the two regular drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : golden Gate in the Gate
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus have definitely sm@@ ashed in the Europa League &apos;s first group game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Team will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga , with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga club against L@@ ever@@ k@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B @-@ Coach open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; given the high stress of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his regular eleven at the R@@ eus position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , he announced a change in the position of the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master craftsmen Roman bür@@ ki . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football coach praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in use in all European league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ me statement of fellow players R@@ eus , that the final one for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , keeps middle @-@ field player Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot car : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological leader when it comes to changing the car . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ ett decided on a strategy paper from the house of transport minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt talked about a &quot; new mobility age &quot; at Frankfurt Motor Show on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of industry at the IAA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transportation &apos;s strategy paper emphasizes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid rise to digital radio communications . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; currently , a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to be br@@ ushed with no additional liability risks , the federal government wants to &quot; review the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example , Germany wants to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ driving cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , the federal government wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only seen people as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as increasingly as automated driving takes over the car , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in a matter of seconds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 20@@ 25 , the authors of the study estimate the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the German Social Democratic S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a survey by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , conducted on Wednesday , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail over the next ten years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in France , 21 percent of those surve@@ yed pay rise to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , 33 percent in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom report , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at least 15 percent in flowing traffic could be envis@@ aged on the motorway , 45 percent in traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well , every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to present status , the Düsseldorf @-@ based company wants to only beat the title fight for the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the final decision should be made at the latest on September 22 , 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , Bol@@ l was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor date in China . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 34 year old German champion is expected to return , Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; the single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ham@@ elin , who runs the S@@ etz@@ ler in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also lack@@ ed and we were Europe champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared the World Ranking List . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has attracted a serious injury on the right leg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the champi@@ ons League game at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kling by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first diagnosis , when the 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow @-@ player from Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ itz , pointed to a breaking point . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday , the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in the skir@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of the Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from the 18th of September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good chance that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal , Montreal and Paris . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ dies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the exhibits give an insight into the unlikely work of the man who wrote fashion history , without ever having completed a training . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not set up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work that was used for a lot of effort : to promote the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was dedicated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Kur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have spar@@ ed 14 tons of material . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shortly before the start of the October festival , a special highlight was : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the exhibition , too , Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old ted@@ dy is to be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ matic fashion attempts by the designer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; playing with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , he taught the throwing of fashion himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , I bought them naturally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in great quantities for customers who , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the early times of the l@@ ousy tip mode , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt calls for a few examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as pockets and in regional costumes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , leaning on past stit@@ ches , is an increasing order potential . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany , are no longer on the market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with us , they already constitute half of all orders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , Mo@@ sto@@ j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of sales have been cut off . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is almost no private specialty shops , as well as wholesale trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , our products hardly reach the customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , exports , currently to Russia and the USA are weaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger external office of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Applied Sciences - at the Faculty of Applied Arts , special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to counter the competition from the Asian region , high quality and innovative products must be found . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a couple of years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ introduced the historic snow tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in doing so , the machine sticks small glob@@ ules in some places . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ smith &apos;s masterpiece in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not start with the traditional P@@ lau@@ ener tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , I see my jewellery as modern am@@ bass@@ adors of the l@@ ousy tip . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you should not touch legends , but Disney will still dare to join a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic child maid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws , is still unclear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already firm : Ro@@ b Marshall , last but not least with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI drives to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group appointed with the steering of the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new businesses and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list for controlling the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of governmental enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , which identifies sectors and companies that are not subject to investment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after and after testing , the system will be tested and improved by test programs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is crucial since it assign@@ s a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring an open @-@ state business environment and open the market open , the statement said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen up controls on the powers transferred to the companies , ensuring companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also stated that China will allow borders to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign companies and provide better services for them , &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were reported as reported in a declaration published after the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es and thus depri@@ ve consumers of a significantly higher dose of neur@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of mis@@ leading industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; large predat@@ ors , however , are already so heavily polluted with mercury that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ comprehensible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU according to F@@ ood@@ watch aims to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limits of other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller cem@@ et@@ fish such as car@@ p are usually so low that they are already keeping the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defle@@ ction maneu@@ ver , which alone helps the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; declared Wolfgang Sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which is particularly rich in predat@@ ory fishes through the food chain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small quantities of the nerve system can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very small amounts of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declared on its homepage with regard to the current top values , however , that a &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercury enters the environment , mainly through coal combustion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations are expecting more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
