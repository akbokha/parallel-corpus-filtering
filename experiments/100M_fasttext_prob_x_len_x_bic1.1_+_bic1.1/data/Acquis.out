&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be used in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on safety measures as necessary .
the objective of the precau@@ tionary measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the distributing of significant quantities of nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear fis@@ sur@@ es for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a bran@@ ching by the risk of early detection .
for the achievement of the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial confin@@ ement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the audit carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity rejected for each material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified Me@@ gen for a given period of time .
in carrying out their follow @-@ up examinations , the organization in accordance with Article 3 makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system .
the accounting and control system of the Community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of their security measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following types and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more intended and appropriate in the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of removed nuclear and stock quantities ;
( B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , checking and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) methods for ass@@ essing the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this agreement do not extend to material in mining or iron ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an@@ - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the association of the organisation shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ hon@@ ic enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured , or is imported into the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , is subject to the other security measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the provisions specified in Article 11 are not possible or desired , the Community and the Community consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the Community shall am@@ end that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
upon request of the Community , the organisation liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) Partic@@ ular fis@@ sile material , when used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community the organisation liber@@ ates nuclear materials , which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with the present Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire material quantity liber@@ ated by this Article in the states is at no time more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates through multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
should the delivered core material be processed or stored together with core material subject to the security measures according to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the Organization supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization under this Convention , in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements can be extended or amended without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the suppl@@ em@@ ental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States undertake all efforts to make these agreements come into effect within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
based on the initial report mentioned in Article 62 , the organisation records a summar@@ ised inventory of the total core material underlying the securing measures in the States , regardless of its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory list as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of its subsequent tests .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference for international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources problems .
C ) It is the goal of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible is spent within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to ensure that this objective is achieved .
D ) The EEC and the organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed carrying out and management of this agreement and the central bonds in order to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the name of &quot; special transaction account , &quot; which is made up of the funds that member states contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is governed by the Organization as Administrator and is used only for the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or indi@@ gent debit notes of the member state , which must be paid on demand in the currency of the State at the Order of the Organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the office of the Organization in the relevant country .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments ( namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the order within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time that was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may request payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional represent@@ ations to the cash or the school @-@ j@@ ash to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in a reasonable manner .
in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be governed by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC :
( III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit transfer capacity to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the concerned countries may be regulated by contributions from other sources .
every transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , irrespective of whether or not it is considered a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and managed by the pre@@ am@@ ble for this agreement , as stated in letter b ) .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization which is bound by a loan or loan for a programme or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions that are generally applicable to the development loan granted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able for ten years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this watch are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
each special transaction loan is to be rejected by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is stated in particular .
the proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services established in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction pursuant to what the car@@ et@@ aker has at the time of the loan granted .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State in question as soon as possible .
until full disclosure of all special transaction loans , the ste@@ ward will inform the EEC of the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction loan , the Managing Director teaches the EW@@ G four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
as soon as possible , the administrator delivers a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tors of the Organization for this account closure as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization .
after a full payment of the special transaction loan , the Managing Director of the EW@@ G conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and conduc@@ ts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts to be financed from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards until full output of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action figures and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement has not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation may arrange , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be invalid with immediate effect .
if the total amount of a special transaction loan granted by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement is rep@@ aid and referred back to Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Government of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat forwards these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the Reg@@ ular Appro@@ val of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the Organization .
this agreement is written in two in@@ scrip@@ tions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each text is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a correspondence to am@@ end the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - HA@@ T has issued the following regulation :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plasma Physics
the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; is represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission . &quot;
the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program comprises the creation of a large test facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a common company under Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called the &quot; Joint Company JET . &quot;
Switzerland has been involved in research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
up to the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion even extensive work is to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to speed up their respective research , which have gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement will enable every contracting party to benefit from the greatest possible benefits by mer@@ ging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for the bilateral research work , i.e. to achieve the common goal of this research work , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , quicker .
to achieve the target of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Annex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
to ensure effective collaboration , the Swiss Programme is taking over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be expanded or amended by examining the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
each time the contracting parties adopt a new programme , the programs listed in Annex I and II to the present Convention shall take place .
the association provided in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- the exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom countries , Switzerland and third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated Third Parties &quot; and the Labor@@ atories that cooperate on the Eur@@ atom programme ;

with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange concluded between the Commission and the associated bodies , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Human Resources Sharing . &quot;
with regard to the stake in the JET , Switzerland is a member of the Joint Company JET with the date of entry into force of the present agreement , the statute of which it accepts .
Eur@@ atom is also concerned that Switzerland may become a contractual partner of any contract whose purpose falls within the scope of the present agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with the execution of the association provided in Article 2 , Section 1 of the present Convention shall be described in Articles 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
in particular , the association agreement is intended to introduce a steering committee , to which the competent representatives of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat belong .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to ensure that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the goals of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group deployed within the Eur@@ atom programme - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , fulfil@@ s this task with regard to all research and development activities related to this agreement .
it promotes , in particular , the co @-@ operation and co @-@ ordination of the associated organs and establishes their T * activity in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme as well as the common objective specified in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Procedure , the VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives to the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities seek .

I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community for these changes , and propose you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the Mobili@@ zation of Member States &apos; demands in the context of the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries if the banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreements could be closed up to the total amount of the order paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this equ@@ ates to 50 % of all future investment funds in the member countries .
however , some conditions are already mentioned herein@@ after , for whose application the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without a total of five years being exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a loan opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made before the end of a month after completion of the stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take account of the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S at the respective time on the basis of similar conditions , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the Li@@ bor rate increased by a corresponding margin .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
I invite me to take a closer look at the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are estimated at the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass body weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring that the actual annual amount is not exceeding the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in the technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the Community is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year concerned .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected from this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of 10 v.@@ s. ad val@@ or@@ em .

the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall take into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 .
the total volume mentioned under number 2 will be set on the day of the Greek accession to the Community on 23@@ ,000 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the community market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions to prevent the sale of residues from frozen meat through the implementation of the regulation on the sale of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c ) of the Convention for the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ cen@@ tives and Trade Agreement .
Argentina , in particular , guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by granting export lic@@ ences set out within the agreement specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under number 1 .
in its turn , the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the presentation of an export license issued by the relevant authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government .
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence may be wai@@ ved .
in addition , it is stipulated that the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals advises the quantities on which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be en@@ forced by country of destination if necessary .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and does not work smoothly .
he regularly reviews the trend on the H@@ amm@@ el , the lamb and the goat &apos;s meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are of importance to the goal listed under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this Agreement shall not be imp@@ acted by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat &apos;s meat are carried out under the agreement not mentioned in the Agreement .
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising in the implementation of this Agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount determined under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount expected from the entry into force of this agreement to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual amount and takes into account the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it shall be valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to inform your government about this .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I appeal to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :

I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations relating to the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in conjunction with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat .
in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of h@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is exist@@ ential and that it must be ensured that the normal sale of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb is not affected in these markets , I honour myself to propose the following agreements :

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Uruguay on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and Lamb
I invite me to take a closer look at the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or chill@@ ed h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff of tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff of tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined according to the Community in the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the actual annual amount is not exceeding the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in the technology and trade , the two parties agree to each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community demands the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the common market has not been affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products collected from this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of 10 v.@@ s. ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set under number 2 corresponding to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this shall take into account the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ etter of exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 .
the total volume mentioned under number 2 will be set to 5 800 metric tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the time of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community counter@@ measures provisions so that the sale of provisions of intervention to frozen meat does not under@@ mine the passage of Urugu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ep@@ skin .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of ref@@ unds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from the slaughter of certain living sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions which comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c ) of the Convention for the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ cen@@ tives and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by giving export lic@@ ences specified in this agreement for the products mentioned under number 1 .
in its turn , the Community under@@ takes to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the presentation of an export license which is designated by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , it is stipulated that the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals advises the quantities on which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these data may be en@@ forced by country of destination if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other .
it shall be valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government approval with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by repeatedly di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively in the volume of the blood cell flood in the total volume .
in anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group identification , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents in the blood group identification of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ lled , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter indicates the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scop@@ ically visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group identification , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B ser@@ ums contain 256 different units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparing the International Standard Serbian anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in a fluid form according to label is at most one year after the last satisfactory effectiveness test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents at the label is based on the results of the trials ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is sealed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of not more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent governmental body can determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the agent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for speci@@ f@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
the re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments , gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents identified for international exchange for blood group determination should not be d@@ yed arti@@ fici@@ ally , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group identification are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a tank is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a tank must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of the re@@ agents to determine blood group identification .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents are to be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood group identification can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective portion .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain any substances of human origin .
each container is a black on white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed to re@@ plen@@ ish ,
