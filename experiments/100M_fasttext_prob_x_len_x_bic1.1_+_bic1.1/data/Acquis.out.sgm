<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services established in a Member State; ii) in developing countries that are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction pursuant to what the caretaker has at the time of the loan granted.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid back in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the Member State in question as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full disclosure of all special transaction loans, the steward will inform the EEC of the plans and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction loan, the Managing Director teaches the EWG four times a year on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the administrator delivers a detailed account statement of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditors of the Organization for this account closure as soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="756">After a full payment of the special transaction loan, the Managing Director of the EWG conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction bank as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and conducts appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts to be financed from the account and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
