this document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations concerning the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. cha@@ otic thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal elation ) alternate with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inhal@@ ation or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy should be removed , the dose should be adjusted to A@@ bili@@ fy .
this interfer@@ es with the transmission of signals between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neur@@ ons .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably acts above all as a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser degree than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the brain &apos;s activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurring .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was studied in three trials over to a year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased agitation over a period of two hours .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ sed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased agitation , compared with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the patient &apos;s symptoms were examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to intake .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg significantly increased the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving placebo .
in four of the five short @-@ term studies , A@@ bili@@ fy was less effective than placebo in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the resum@@ ption of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled access ) , hyper@@ activity ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( nausea ) , ob@@ sti@@ pation ( increased s@@ ali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were predomin@@ ant .
moreover , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who mostly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
a lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even when treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ fol@@ k@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ter and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appear in a patient treated with A@@ bili@@ fy , it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops symptoms and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
this is why Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
in 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma , or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical an@@ psych@@ otic agents who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ gs , poly@@ phen@@ ols , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
because of the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ abo@@ ards the common application of highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 results in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive met@@ abo@@ ards .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ om@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ om@@ orph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
this medicine may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data state for safety in humans and due to the concern in the reproductive studies of animals unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole received a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia , and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ a@@ que ap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity with the dop@@ amine D and D3 receptor and the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor and a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D , to the alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and the hist@@ amine receptor .
with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent decrease of binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ and , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the ground .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents &quot; response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a 26 @-@ week placebo @-@ controlled study on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significant reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies lasting 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a comparable percentage of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a 26 @-@ week placebo @-@ controlled study , followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself to placebo in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ lash , predominantly in the prevention of rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean eli@@ oration period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a population @-@ specific evaluation on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not indicate clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in patients with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ o@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al cor@@ tex carcin@@ omas / day ( equivalent to 10@@ x of Middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was as@@ cer@@ tained as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates in the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to Ex@@ positions of 3 - and 11 @-@ times the Middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks of fixed dosing with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were compared as a solution for accepting 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geometric C@@ max average of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
once clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended taking care of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given based on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if an advanced or@@ al treatment is indicated by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that have been caused differently than schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed regarding extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( either prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ fol@@ k@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ zel@@ ter and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS include high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ gs , poly@@ phen@@ ols , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ony and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored with regard to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .

the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters emerged , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events associated with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose sei@@ zur@@ es , undesi@@ rable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms as to placebo and similar to the lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the observed mean improvement from bas@@ eline on P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score in the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 % of respon@@ dents &quot; response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions @-@ Rate @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a 26 @-@ week placebo @-@ controlled study on stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) significantly reduced the decline rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % placebo .
in an or@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients reported weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a 26 @-@ week placebo @-@ controlled study , followed by a 74 @-@ week extension of man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed itself to placebo in terms of the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ lash , predominantly in the prevention of rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies involving healthy subjects , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after IV application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns regarding mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent non @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al cor@@ tex carcin@@ omas / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was also detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates in the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to the expos@@ ures of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the intermediate steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el treatment .
looking at only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between medicines in terms of efficacy studies such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils before the start of the treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side @-@ effects compared to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ els .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ x@@ ane Bio@@ Science Limited approval for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
under sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an al@@ bum@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation by pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other parts of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in patients no repeated Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment courses should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the plat@@ el@@ et number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dys@@ functions ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a caus@@ al toxic@@ ity related to Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting , and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ lling methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to use no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised about a sperm conservation before treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects , which occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III pi@@ vot@@ al phase III trial .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection was established with these events .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ ub@@ ules ingredient which promotes the contrac@@ tion of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ a and stabili@@ ses the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ composition .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that al@@ bum@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of al@@ bum@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ ic epitheli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ al@@ umin@@ ous receptor and due to the al@@ b@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm non @-@ verbal trials and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III trial study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el mon@@ otherapy every 3 weeks , either as a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for ab@@ lation of bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the complete pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 . the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase after IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection from pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearing of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue hist@@ ories , we report that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is primarily metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ d@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative intake of the un@@ altered active substance was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing .
however , only a few data is available about patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for the placing on the market will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to market launch :
• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging instructions . • Un@@ clear pic@@ torial representation of the correct application of the product provided cool@@ ers for the transport by the patients .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood ei@@ sen@@ ic values , in which complications may arise in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before surgery and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
treatment with ab@@ sc@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal de@@ priv@@ ation or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
fl@@ amed was treated as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study of 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia .
at least eight weeks , E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to the un@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ sent@@ amed under the skin were investigated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were switched to ab@@ sent@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , persistent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
fl@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
fl@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Medi@@ ce pharmaceuticals P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG approval for the placing of fl@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion requirement in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia following chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if bleeding @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , for planned larger surgical procedures , which demand a large volume of blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic intervention in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may be applied which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , in which the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor needs assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values above or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration can be observed in a patient .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should aim to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses as patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses as patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dosage increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , gender , and total disease burden ; therefore , the doctor needs assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should aim to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for control of an@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of rep@@ tiles ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared with the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l has risen compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ sis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of the re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ tes by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , an response to epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required , should be treated at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the commen@@ cement of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the wa@@ ve@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
here epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n on er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not get an ab@@ sc@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ ia known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
in patients who are fores@@ een for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases ; severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
in patients with sudden loss of effect , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the reverse dose value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid , or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ to@@ xi@@ co@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ ticul@@ u@@ lo@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the administration of epo@@ eti@@ n if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the symptoms of an@@ emia and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically manifest cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ free and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa drugs .
if the H@@ b increase exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are fores@@ een for larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that in the case of treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ L an increased risk of postoperative epitheli@@ al / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine did not prove that in tumor patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , they improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned when ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was stri@@ ven
if epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is applied along with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose should be adapted to the increasing ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumour tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F in terms of hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
about th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accidents , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically engineered epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrates are identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ st@@ osis ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ oma , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast cancer , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas , and 30 more ) .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n showed consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality compared to controls with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common malign@@ an@@ cies .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data .
epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa provisions following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy subjects and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa &apos;s serum levels are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ ital fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for humans , epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa led to reduced federal body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .

the holder of the permission for the placing on the market has to supply the medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials prior to the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states : • Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging examples . • Con@@ trac@@ tual representation of the correct application of the product provided by the patients .
the owner of the licence for the placing on the market has to ensure that the pharmac@@ os @-@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is operational in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is applied in the traffic .
the owner of the licence for the placing on the market comm@@ its himself to the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in the pharmac@@ os @-@ gil@@ ance plan as well as additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as defined in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application and to update the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent update .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the medicine ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information that may affect the safety specification ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmaceutical @-@ gil@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmaceutical @-@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • after prompt by the E@@ MEA
• have suffered a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis in the veins ( deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a blood c@@ lot occurred before you , for example .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during treatment with ab@@ sent@@ ery it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ forms during further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dis@@ solving the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency should be considered and treated before starting treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will break your treatment with ab@@ sc@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , the stre@@ amed should be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value might be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
at elevated or rising levels of potassium your doctor may take into account an interruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically apparent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al failure .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ eti@@ n @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the desired effect should be considered for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your dose dose appropriately to minimize the risk of thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the advantages derived from treatment with epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have already occurred ( e.g. a deep v@@ ein thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patient , consider that fl@@ amed effects like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumor neg@@ atively .
if you &apos;re ahead of a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the start of treatment and treated accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get t@@ amed because there is an increased risk of drop@@ let formation after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken / use other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription drug .
if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ eti@@ n al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means to build the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) is addressing the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of the treatment and to ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of fl@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , distributed on two equal sized inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to check the success of your treatment and to ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and to ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given in 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the procedure and another 4 days after the surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash the fl@@ amed yourself under the skin .

eye li@@ ds and lips ( quin@@ ine o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , feeling of heat and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia means that no longer sufficient red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see the section called &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , there may be a blood drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) regardless of the treatment with ab@@ s@@ amed .
treatment with ab@@ s@@ amed can be associated with an increased risk of blood sample formation after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is too high

Ac@@ la@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as during the attack ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should receive at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment . before the first in@@ fusion , patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ last@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate the Ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , almost 8 000 elderly women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years was investigated .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was studied .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a was tested in a total of 3@@ 57 patients in two trials and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75 % in comparison with the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis surgery ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study involving men and women with acet@@ ate frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ la@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients in Ac@@ last@@ a are exposed to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ last@@ a manufacturer provides information on physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ a to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , including information on how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the placing on the market of Ac@@ last@@ a throughout the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The pack supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and in breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Ac@@ last@@ a once a year is recommended for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Pa@@ get .
after treatment of the Pa@@ get with Ac@@ last@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently @-@ administered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ a may be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ credited is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent to bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who need dental interventions , no data is available , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ a may be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
incidence of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ a ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d was associated with kidney dysfunction , which referred to as decrease of the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured every year before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were compared to the placebo group for three years in a clinical study in oste@@ opor@@ osis .
a temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a compared to 0.8 % of those treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium figures , which were below the normal level of the threshold ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a in the Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the morph@@ ological Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a recently acquired hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study , local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain were reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , via oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extrac@@ tions or other dental interven@@ es .
7 Study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area with a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ a and placebo .
in case of over@@ dose leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by using oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ last@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spinal frac@@ tures Ac@@ last@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients from 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on acet@@ ate frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ a showed an equally lasting effect over three years , which reduced in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) increased bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , the neck diameter by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology at 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CAT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal Pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ a reduced B@@ SAP significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the output value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the output value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscul@@ arly ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the Ac@@ la@@ a treated group , compared with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , in comparison to placebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased at all time points compared to placebo .
the Ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.4 % at the total half and 4.3 % at the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ised 50@@ 8 men and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( trial CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the annual administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was not inferior to the weekly administration of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a disease was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially mild to moderate @-@ moderate morph@@ ological paste of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief compared to bas@@ eline for Ac@@ la@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ ses at the end of the six @-@ month study ( addressed to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from 143 with Ac@@ la@@ a and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ a , compared with 71 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , during an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ off and multiple 5 and 15 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
then the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life hours t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long phase of elimination with terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ bs@@ wer@@ time t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above ½ -@@ values ) represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of metaboli@@ zed substances by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , nutrient @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney function disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only contains limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in case studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C - the 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 6@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C , equivalent to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all doses , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum @-@ calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current safety , pharmaceutical @-@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone was reached ( for pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . • E@@ MEA request .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ d is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
in the case of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ a works by normal@@ ising bone remo@@ del@@ ing , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ a .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ a with other medicines please tell your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you have taken and / or adopted other medicines , even if it is not a prescription drug .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ a together with food and drink , be concerned that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions , you should take sufficient fluid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ la@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low over time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a was missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating the treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a If you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ last@@ a , please take your next doctor appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ a .
at present , it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms with you after you have received Ac@@ la@@ a .
physical signs of low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially around the mouth .
flu , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling , drow@@ sin@@ ess , trem@@ bling , temporary loss of consciousness , diar@@ rhe@@ a , stomach upset , stomach pain , hypertension , facial redness , short breathe , skin rash , swe@@ ating , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins , tissue cor@@ ru@@ gation and thirst .
persistent sor@@ eness and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
allergic reactions including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this information .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ tures , the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ last@@ a should be performed two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after administration of Ac@@ last@@ a , patients have to be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling effect on bone remo@@ del@@ ing , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a .
in addition , it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ a .
in patients with a recently @-@ administered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ a .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , A@@ COMP@@ LIA also has a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above , respectively , which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and additionally one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7@@ ,000 patients , in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking compared to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the attitude of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA ? he The Most Common Side Effects of A@@ COMP@@ LIA detected during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti @-@ depres@@ s@@ ants as it increases the risk of depression and can , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ COMP@@ LIA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ol ( drugs for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .

the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that A@@ COMP@@ A@@ LIA &apos;s efficacy in reducing weight in patients with obesity or overweight people
medicines used in patients who need it for health reasons and not for cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ conn@@ aissance packages for patients and physicians ) , and around the Ar@@ z
in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which also have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depression or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ ants ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ is may not be used in case of depres@@ sive disorders unless the benefit of the treatment in the individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other related persons may point out that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ occurrence of such symptoms and seek medical advice immediately if these symptoms occur .
• Greater patients The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) before less than 6 months have been carried out by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ . l@@ n
Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , St. John &apos;s wort has not been studied , is thought that the simultaneous administration of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors reduces the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
in addition , 3@@ 800 patients were examined in other indications as well as in patients with obesity .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects that occurred under treatment in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metabolism diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significantly higher than the corresponding placement coordinates ( for adverse events ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä
only slight symptoms were observed in a case study in which a limited number of people have given dispos@@ als of up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and at the same time existing hypertension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
n weight reduction after one year was for COMP@@ A@@ LIA 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4,@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
the patients treated with A@@ COMP@@ LIA 20 mg , and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years , the difference in overall weight reduction was between A@@ COMP@@ LIA and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 Weight reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , an average amount of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des of 6.@@ 9 % was seen ( bas@@ eline tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ patients 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo
the percentage share of patients reaching a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference in the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2,@@ 6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . LN
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ at 20 mg were around 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ . and about 50 % explained by the weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

5.3 Pre@@ cious data on safety of adverse events , which were not observed in clinical trials , but which were not observed in humans after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were considered to be relevant for clinical use :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ an@@ ant , no undesi@@ rable effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disorders .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ out@@ in uter@@ o and by means of lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or in memory .

the present document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ etic drug ) is not shown . • It can be applied along with another di@@ ab@@ etic drug ( dual therapy ) .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in , it can be applied in patients ( especially overweight patients ) who cannot be satisfied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ or or insulin , the present dose of the sul@@ fon@@ ate resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar level ) ; this should reduce the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ ate resin or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was investigated ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ ate resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional dose of Ac@@ tos to the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fa drugs decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who increased Ac@@ tos additionally to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who received additional placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were vision disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ as@@ thesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as part of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited appro@@ ving Ac@@ tos for the entire European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable for contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor ( e.g. early cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , and e@@ dem@@ a when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was carried out .
this study showed an increase in heart failure reports , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected , which can ag@@ itate fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparison @-@ controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 4.2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with an insulin or as a two @-@ subject combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , a di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a was reported under the treatment of thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological diagnosis should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
the patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if one patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ er inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal during pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not inv@@ alu@@ able in this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refra@@ ction index of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic active substances .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as compared to placebo , but less often than in comparison groups with met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lu@@ rea .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one respectively .
since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures of random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison media .
over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , subsequently 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated in the animal model leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ age in the case of an insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide versus mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years at the beginning of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient to insulin were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo in spite of three months of optimization of insulin .
in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to patients receiving insulin only ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients for 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated LD@@ L cholesterol levels was observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ mat@@ o@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ en@@ ci@@ dal .
compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while lower levels of met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both with effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the efficacy in roughly three times the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral treatment of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies coinci@@ ded with mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume aug@@ mentation with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the hyper@@ sensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother &apos;s animal by decreasing the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased in@@ dependen@@ cies of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tumours .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medicine .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medicine .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were examined with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide .
in clinical trials over 1 year , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the al@@ bum@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , both over an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
although the study missed the target with respect to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ mortal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks , indicating how good the blood sugar is .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered as strongly as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
dos@@ ages of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ as may also be adjusted if they are administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package contents ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane &apos;s benefits were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can perceive the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required for the change to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken by them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled di@@ ab@@ etic therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can , however , develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grapes , sweets , bis@@ cuits or juice containing sugar . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum duration is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster resp@@ . delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of spl@@ itting ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ med@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu .
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin humane ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of fast acting insulin must be raised , followed by the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the location of the surgery : during insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ emat@@ oma can occur at the injection point ) .
di@@ abe@@ tics should therefore always have grapes , sweets , bis@@ cuits or juice containing sugar . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical study in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients undergoing major surgical procedures has shown that a 42 % reduction in mortality induced by intraven@@ ous acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id ( blood sugar 4,@@ 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the actual maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of action amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited but suggest that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to adults .
in@@ fusion systems with Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ U. / ml insulin human in the in@@ fusion fluids of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D- glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times .

the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adolescents ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the intraven@@ ous application of acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id from finished p@@ ens or cartridges should be an exception and only occur in situations where no breakthrough cylinders are available .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .

this can happen : if you inj@@ ure too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you exercise more than otherwise physically
always put the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready @-@ to @-@ use p@@ ens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the cap . • A@@ void the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( figure A ) • Drag the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid air injection and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a couple of times with your finger gently against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le the needle continues upward , press the push button in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upwards , press the button on the right ( figure C ) • Now you have to take a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap on the pen again in such a way that the number 0 is relative to the dosing mark ( Figure D ) • Check if the pressure button is pressed entirely .
when the button is not able to move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pressure button moves outside while turning the closing cap • The scale below the press button ( press stud scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ dress the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the end cap forward or backward until you have set the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance . then turn off the cap and set it up again in such a way that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during the injection • Hold down the button after the injection until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
you may not adjust a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the remaining scale to estimate how much insulin remains , but you can not use it to set or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in joints ) or rheum@@ atic nodes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still higher than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months , so it is recommended that patients with aden@@ ur@@ ic or other medicines treat rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months of treatment .
the drug is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once a day 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year .
in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 m@@ g. a day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of 80 mg once a day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily received 120 mg , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in lowering the ur@@ ic acid pi@@ eg@@ els in the blood it was more effective than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases that have already lead to deposits of ur@@ an@@ ium ( including a medical history known from the medical history and / or rheum@@ atic ) .
if the serum retention rate is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
as there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ ma @-@ acid @-@ induc@@ ing drugs , acute g@@ out can occur during the treatment commen@@ ce , as the reduction of the serum resin pi@@ eg@@ els initially allows to mobili@@ se ure@@ tic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases can increase so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , mild symptoms of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was did not conduct menop@@ ause studies on fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a blocking of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in the level of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be applied along with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having to adjust the dose for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ atum , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ing effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous ing@@ es@@ tion of an ant@@ acid , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delays the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a reduction in C@@ max by 32 % , but does not cause any significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies cannot be related to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not include direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ et compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events that could arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported more than once in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies no severe skin rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with fi@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the adverse events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ ot@@ es@@ thesia , flash@@ y , skin dis@@ col@@ oration , skin irrit@@ ation , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ic , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase of the TS@@ H concentration in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te count , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the effect of ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and is produced in the context of the reaction sk@@ as@@ k@@ ade Hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , not pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area .
clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies in Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three month of serum har@@ den@@ ers were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 134 ) or al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum at@@ in@@ inal value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with commonly used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority both for treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to treatment with the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 times daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summari@@ zed for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
the lowering of the serum resin table to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and permanently maintained throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels of serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was reached at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 times daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 times daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum resin concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum resin concentrations to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment for a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the node , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the lymp@@ h node up to 24 % in 54 % of the patients .
elevated TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ A / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after the intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum resin concentrations was observed , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bind to al@@ bum@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ lab@@ eled F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
apart from ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair ( 12 % ) , acet@@ ate glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) and other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) found themselves again .
special patient groups of kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal ren@@ al function .
the mean total AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately 1.8 @-@ times of 7,5 g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe ni@@ pp@@ le function .
12 Li@@ ver function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- / gh @-@ Classi@@ fication B ) Li@@ ver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that fi@@ bre@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately 3 times the age of human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was observed , which was accompanied by a reduction in the up@@ lift capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bit with ex@@ positions , which amounted to approximately 13 times the human therapeutic exposure , did not give ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients with which the last three month of serum har@@ den@@ ers were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum resin concentrations to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheum@@ atism , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment for a g@@ out ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those who only received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is equivalent to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , ag@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( swal@@ lowing problems ) , abor@@ ted abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic bu@@ zz@@ ing .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 , or any of the other ingredients AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it should not be applied in case of diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. an approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow the steps below to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• Dur@@ ing the day AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or de@@ compose the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty should be given only with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ tures , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partly these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible allergic reactions , and patients should be pointed out , when symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn , seek treatment and seek medical consultation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe diar@@ rhe@@ a side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all the dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , rarely ( after market introduction ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients with a surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning while taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week provided .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , which recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also for oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum @-@ calcium intake was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at &apos;s sequence of an oral over@@ dose may be hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the average serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) than in the group under al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2.@@ 800 I.@@ E. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency after 15 weeks ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 n@@ g / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .
the therapeu@@ tical equi@@ val@@ ence of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in phase III studies , average BM@@ D asc@@ ents with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the share of patients who suffered from one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the BM@@ D asc@@ ents of the spine and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to stop ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was also maintained .
fit was made up of two placebo @-@ controlled studies where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate score by 47 % ( al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption based on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability correspon@@ dingly decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) did not lead to clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies on rats have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively selected substance were ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clear@@ ances did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that it affects the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .
res@@ or@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) following the administration of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after a ni@@ gh@@ tly fast and two hours before taking a meal , the mean surface below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 n@@ g • h / ml ( without taking into account endo@@ genous vitamin D3 mirrors ) .
the average maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and medi@@ an time up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ ated in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed in the kidney to 1.@@ 25 @-@ di@@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion In the treatment of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 on healthy subjects the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in urine was 2.4 % after 48 hours , in the put@@ t after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nevertheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
therefore , in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is given adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted kidney or liver to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , and the use of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining for example , how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further trials were carried out to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , Adv@@ agra@@ f cannot be applied .
patients and physicians must be careful if other ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken at the same time with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the an@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level determin@@ ations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus valley mirrors should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both veneer and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley Mir@@ ror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate late transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with a low clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose scheme can take several days before the ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral ing@@ es@@ tion of medicines during the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust a transplan@@ t of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to take place in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the total daily dose .
after a transplan@@ t from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation should begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t rejection .
for adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients , came in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Because the ren@@ al function ex@@ erts no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum , a calculation of the cre@@ atine contents and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the blood level in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ c controls .
it is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Valley Mir@@ ror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ents of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled following conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ an@@ agra@@ f , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or by using substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the st@@ ady State has occurred .
the indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the overall blood of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in the kidneys - and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which have proven to be chem@@ ically resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data is available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f .
because of possible interactions which may lead to a reduction in the blood lip@@ id levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances .
in rare cases , aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tic hyper@@ tro@@ phy designated as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore occur also under an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .

the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strong interaction has been made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one as used in acute rejection reactions can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines which are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of en@@ doc@@ rine , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures are particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal testing have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of patients with transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not pri@@ cel@@ ess ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ al ) .
cases of non @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
due to its high molecular weight , low water solu@@ bility and high adhesion to er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thus preventing the tran@@ scription of a specific series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus following other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognised primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplantation .
175 l@@ ung@@ lung transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ at@@ re@@ transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after a bow@@ el transplan@@ t were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f found in these published studies the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was applied to primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome , was less common in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases for the emergence of a Bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
P@@ ank@@ re@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t , which were random@@ ised to receive tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after intestinal transplantation showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ emat@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the dis@@ counted fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile .
the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in stable patients who were killed by pro@@ gra@@ f ( once daily ) at a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose .

advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ utter disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Adv@@ ant@@ ages are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enables it to form the human factor VI@@ II .
advance is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made differently , so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , Adv@@ ate &apos;s efficacy in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood sep@@ als was &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; rated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VI@@ II .
lawyers must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approval for the placing on the market of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , a proper determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their response to Factor VI@@ II , different in vivo recovery achieve and exhibit different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to verify an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ory values it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of administration should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma with modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VI@@ II , where the risk depends on the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors .
in previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which were present in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) who performed all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance @-@ rate showed adequate levels on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed moderate to moderate ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were diagnosed with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients with a current clinical study were 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ tr@@ es against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported adverse events .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody reflection against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were isolated from the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the first approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the official approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw his application for Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s application for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans .
Adv@@ ex@@ in should have inj@@ ected directly into the tumor and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein once more .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ women &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdom@@ en , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP responded to the company &apos;s responses to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the review of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in &apos;s injection in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors has advantages for patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company did not adequately demonstrate that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified ingredient release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al paths caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and young people over 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients reported that the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze had a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients with aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , c@@ logging , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sleep@@ iness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze must also not be used in patients suffering from a lack of glaucoma ( increased intraocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of air in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without ch@@ ewing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
as a result of the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application should be as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease with time during long @-@ term use .
after reg@@ ression of the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy as required .
as Aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the treatment has ended .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , Nap@@ zu@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data will not suff@@ ice to give appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to make recommendations for dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or ampli@@ fication of head@@ aches ) must be removed .
caution : • Pati@@ ents with digital@@ is • Pati@@ ents with ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed as part of clinical trials involving des@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor tests revealed no significant differences between the patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether chlori@@ de was alone or taken with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not inhibit@@ ing , and in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the use of aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drow@@ sin@@ ess which can result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ated mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre @-@ cor@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both the in@@ hibition of releasing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ ules in endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study of adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 were treated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving a@@ en@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the s@@ wollen effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ groups defined by sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
following the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers , it was found that four subjects were dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n poorly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction survey shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine following the exclusive gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was equivalent to exposure after administration of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and Pharmac@@ o@@ il@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation is and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance that can un@@ fold its effect .

after the market launch of lor@@ at@@ radi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or ras@@ hes were reported .
in cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ ase , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also rarely reported .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the tri@@ g@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body has the sy@@ rup , the solution for inclusion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us showed an average decrease of the symptom scores by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ eri@@ us should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing on the market of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited clinical trials experience in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and resum@@ ed after re@@ occurrence .
in case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be treated during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study did not increase the performance of alcohol while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light he@@ ade@@ dness , which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was headache , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study at which up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes the in@@ hibition of releasing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ s as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ Sel@@ tin molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , which was administered in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in a single dose study with adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flux , including the ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectively drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ating and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
an inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhin@@ o con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated on behalf of further forms of the Ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology despite the eti@@ ology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited by a prospective pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine response is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ mat@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of those treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patient demo@@ s were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in vivo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , calorie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences with respect to the toxic@@ ity profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not detect any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations , and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children metaboli@@ ze di@@ lap@@ at@@ adi@@ n between 2 and 11 years and experience a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ in@@ hibition or Sac@@ char@@ ase Is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of the side effects in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
in clinical studies involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at the recommended dose , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily dose of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in controlled clinical studies , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials were not impaired by psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not increase alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ ating and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pre@@ mat@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations higher in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study involving the sy@@ rup formulation of children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are severely metaboli@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) through dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was approximately 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant beta @-@ stimulation after a daily application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max levels of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with recommended doses with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup at a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III @-@ bra@@ cing bottles with a resistant polypropylene seal with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

there is limited clinical trials experience in the application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
immediately before use , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the est@@ ro@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup@@ - and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile noted in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for engaging in the formulation of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

the spread of this poorly @-@ metaboli@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ at@@ ric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or a@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets supports the use of the 2.5 mg dosage for children from 6 to 11 years .

the total incidence of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3,@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended dos@@ ages , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the official approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts his application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus spreads , which can easily spread from human to human because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the part of the influ@@ enza virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the virus &apos;s membrane cover with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as foreign body ) was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
thus , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suff@@ ice to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for vacc@@ ination vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
for further information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
aspir@@ in should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient has taken before and the lik@@ el@@ ihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral drugs reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level .
not curing AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the A@@ gener@@ ase drug , enhanced with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load variation after treatment .
in studies with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the A@@ gener@@ ase drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors after 16 weeks of treatment :
in patients suffering from HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase , together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , led to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
aspir@@ in may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as aspir@@ ated as aspir@@ ation and are det@@ ri@@ mental to high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in body fat distribution ) , oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis , or immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years had out@@ weigh@@ ed the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not detected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as only limited information was available at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the placing on the market of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic sampling of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
aspir@@ in must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ zy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that aspir@@ in or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ation does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver dysfunction with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this drug .
patients with pre @-@ existing h@@ ep@@ atic liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is also given at the same time with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ on content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups .
aspir@@ ation should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ cous membranes participate ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing type of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other illnesses that were necessary to therapy drugs that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ y@@ thro@@ ses occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width are not allowed to be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ zy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeu@@ tical width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
when trying to compensate the low levels of plasma by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver have been observed very often .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
when a patient receives Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r@@ arium and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
up to 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice a day and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily that substanti@@ ate the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan .
52 % degra@@ ded when Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ Val@@ ues of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg rite avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study for use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ geous component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ene and aspir@@ ation are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effects of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentrations of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , since Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ines is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without con@@ current application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may also interact with as@@ gener@@ ase , possibly interact .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are applied in combination with aspir@@ ation .
based on data from other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as aspir@@ in as it can result in absorption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@
con@@ current consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase plasma concentrations and strengthen with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % -@@ confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
in H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases in the plasma level with simultaneous administration of aspir@@ ation are expected .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , aspir@@ in must not be applied along with or@@ ally @-@ taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while caution is required while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data on the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicates a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the lower reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given , as the Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dosage is to be adjusted if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with aspir@@ ation , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not pre@@ dict@@ ably , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treats people with breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was given a reduction in the 12 body weight of offspring during breast@@ feeding .
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mat@@ ernal animal .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , early on and rarely used for treatment .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of aspir@@ ation twice a day .
events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , and laboratory alterations ( degrees 3 to 4 ) were performed under the treatment .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue , increased in@@ tra @-@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cervi@@ cal fat accumulation ( Sti@@ ckers ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ processed individuals who had been treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ cks ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s performed in Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes usually were mild to moderate mark@@ edly , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off .
cases of oste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low @-@ dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory ab@@ norm@@ alities ( degree 3 and 4 ) were very common to those who were treated with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low @-@ dose rite avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M / S / T / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / T / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied for the interpretation of results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r &apos;s associated genetic mak@@ eup creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rite avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ seen patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r inhal@@ ed scheme failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which A@@ gen@@ ase ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly bon@@ ded with low @-@ dose rite avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ cap@@ s@@ ular wave of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was examined three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
19 Based on this data , the beneficial benefit of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; aspir@@ in should be taken into account when optim@@ ising therapy with PI @-@ treated children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max decreased by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given together with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the st@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous eating affects the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imped@@ ed penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration at the st@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
for this reason , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have to be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with aspir@@ ation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment regi@@ mens lead to Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without con@@ current administration of kni@@ gh@@ tly avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas were ben@@ ign in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ bulb .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans , from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , which contained bacterial cell reverse mut@@ ation tests ( am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration test on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring the AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of aspir@@ ation nor after the end of treatment .
toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying additive of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of aspir@@ ation ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
aspir@@ in should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ cous membranes participate ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and disease @-@ dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
up to 50@@ 8 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min @-@ Val@@ ues of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were reached with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg rite avi@@ r .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is required when these drugs are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ ines is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with aspir@@ ation , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of or@@ th@@ o nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ hat@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
during the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was given a reduction in the weight of offspring during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M with acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the benefits of &quot; un@@ bi@@ ased &quot; aspir@@ ation should be taken into account when optim@@ ising therapy with PI @-@ treated children .

toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young , the metabolism path@@ ways are not fully developed so that Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years .
the benefit of the k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion has not been proven in patients with PI pre@@ treated patients or with PI .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , aspir@@ in capsules and solution to take on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , as no dosage recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to take up and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although dosage adjustment for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene gly@@ col@@ on , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that aspir@@ in or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with aspir@@ ation does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
aspir@@ ation should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mu@@ cous membranes participate ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ op@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ y@@ thro@@ ses occur .

based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not well @-@ known . due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us it is not possible to use the propylene gly@@ col contained in the pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , but it is not known whether Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r treats people with breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was given a reduction in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the safety of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are related to taking A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral un@@ pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment regi@@ mens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo were performed either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete treatment rate was 15 % to 52 % of patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete response rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream is to be continued until all visible occur@@ ren@@ ces of the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if in the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only completely cured , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
once a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient must apply the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the puri@@ fied skin area infected with pig@@ ments until the cream is completely absorbed .
there should be a balancing between the benefit of a treatment with is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a balancing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with circumcision of leading stro@@ kes were observed .
an increased risk of severe local irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or had led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions emerged at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences are available for the application of i@@ od@@ ine i@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream directly after a treatment with other cut@@ an@@ ally applied means for the treatment of external s@@ eig@@ ni@@ es in the genital and peri@@ anal area .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the elimination of the ni@@ pp@@ le war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair approach was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions proceed after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme .
if it is necessary because of the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there is currently no data available about long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not have clinical experience , therefore the use in previously treated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy exists .
is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip level .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this use , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ creme .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort for the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 acute l@@ esi@@ ons showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine should be applied with care in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) can be quanti@@ fied neither once nor after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period .
the most common adverse events and possibly with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side @-@ effects in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mic@@ tor@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
bas@@ al melan@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial reported adverse events .
the most common adverse event , as prob@@ able or possibly associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cre@@ ams , was a response in these studies ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of Phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ Cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the review of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream normal skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / fl@@ atten@@ ing ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) occurred ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too heavy f@@ loc@@ cul@@ ation and cal@@ ming ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical studies investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was determined with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could result in nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was found in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous liquid return .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination systemic concentration of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines was detected after the topical application of is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the ni@@ pp@@ ines in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was clearly superior .
in 60 % of patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , patients were completely cured ; this was the case in 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine during five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic nu@@ is@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications for external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and therefore have not been examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies with children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks , respectively ) .
minimal systemic inclusion of the 5 % i@@ od@@ ine i@@ od@@ ine i@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 single bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated obvious half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application , also carried out for four months , yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice in malign@@ ant administration three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has low system absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater number than in the control group with lower U@@ VR .

for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
as a result of the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided due to the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with drugs ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to treat the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of moderate or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the previous response has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , including embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is available to new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3- study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted Drug Inter@@ actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with predominantly severe course form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients were treated with a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months from the beginning of treatment , with a ser@@ o@@ conversion usually within a month under the age of 5 ( average after 26 days vs. 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early retirement from the study ) , no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it was never before ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG level in urine , while patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es showed a variable decrease of G@@ AG in urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal or low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ va activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub @-@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via male @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients had a mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feeder and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement in lung function and the ability to walk that is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically in@@ significant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportion@@ ately to the height of growing children .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease of the G@@ AG mirrors was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) , which remained constant up to the end of the study .
there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a single @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted , investigating the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow @-@ up ) .
in four patients the dose was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased levels of G@@ ag@@ A in week 22 during the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of progression ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe tra@@ verse form limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were carried out at the G@@ AG mirror in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional safety pharmac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in one @-@ off administration , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines except for the ones listed under 6 .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the di@@ lution is under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

10 Prepar@@ ation of an al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( by means of as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • To determine the number of hat@@ ch@@ lings to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
within the given time , the owner of the permission for the placing on the market has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual assessment report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this Register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information for patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I lies an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medications containing chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of reduced effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it , including prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - th@@ inning and application The concentrate for the production of in@@ fusion fluid must be dil@@ uted before application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions emerged , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breath@@ lessness and facial oil .
very common ( occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • red@@ dening • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the delivery document will be updated .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not used immediately , it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , if the di@@ lution is under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
preparation of an al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( by means of as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • first determine the number of fluid @-@ th@@ inning bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is probably easily spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid deficiency ) should also be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood type changes , or where certain other side effects occur , treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ em into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells .
in a major study , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease in a major study .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another cancer drug ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the single administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months for doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells did longer survive in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta compared to the comparison agent .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a licence for the marketing of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
each bottle of carbon dioxide must be dissolved with 4,@@ 2 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of surface area ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after the completion of the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids must be given the day before and during the day of the tel@@ emet@@ ry treatment as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake should be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) during the week before the first tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each application , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking into account the n@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which apply for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degrees 3 ( except ne@@ uro @-@ toxic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment .
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ emat@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or so@@ - at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have shown no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , in comparison to patients aged 65 , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and effectiveness .
in clinical trials , patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require dosage adjustment that could go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase levels of &gt; to 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the plat@@ el@@ et cell counts again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 ha@@ emat@@ ological and ni@@ chth@@ on@@ ous toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was ob@@ - b@@ ated when a pre @-@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with tel@@ emet@@ ric acid must be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ s@@ ali@@ - cy@@ l@@ lic ( &gt; 1.3 g per day ) for at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with a P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by means of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm .
in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can result in reduced emet@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion as a result of increased occurrence of side effects .
this is why caution is required if high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and least 2 days after therapy with tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ re@@ Fi@@ xed for at least 5 days prior to therapy must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy except when it is essential and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
as the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is caused by P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the start of the treatment to solic@@ it advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into breast milk exceeds and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby can not be excluded .

the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 results of three individual P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed @-@ Mon@@ o@@ therapies , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be trac@@ ed back to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal output values of liver function tests .

it has been reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure in tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis in patients reported before , during or after their tel@@ emet@@ ric treatment were reported ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate which exercises its effect by interrup@@ ting important , fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ logical reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the follow@@ er @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant advantage over patients with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of the lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA versus Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after prior chemotherapy had a medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival dropped in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 172 , 6,@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medi@@ an PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = Con@@ fi@@ dence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ compliance limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients required sel@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ eti@@ n / dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ eti@@ n ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4,@@ 3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed as a mono@@ therapeutic agent were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ si@@ - and over a period of 10 minutes .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine in 24 hours after application .
tel@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and half @-@ time in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , who received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ ated epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

each bottle of carbon dioxide must be dissolved with 20 ml of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
23 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 100 mg powder for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg of powder for the production of an in@@ fusion solution
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is used in patients who have not received prior chemotherapy to treat the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma ( malign@@ ant disease of the Ri@@ ppen@@ f@@ ells ) in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , another medicine for the treatment of cancer .
if you have kidney disease or have one before , please discuss it with your doctor or hospital oth@@ ec@@ er , as you may not be allowed to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
blood tests will be performed before each in@@ fusion ; it checks whether your kidney and liver function is sufficient and if you have enough blood cells to get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA to 49 .
your doctor may change the dose or stop treatment if it requires your general condition and if your blood values are too low .
if you also get c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , your doctor will ensure that your body contains sufficient water and you get the necessary medicines to avoid vom@@ iting before and after the C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin dosage .
if you have a liquid collection around the lung , your doctor may decide to remove this liquid before you get A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
if you want to be a child during the treatment or during the first 6 months after the treatment , please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
drug interactions Tell your doctor if you use medicines for pain or inflammation ( swelling ) , such as drugs called &quot; non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ lo@@ ids &quot; ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) , including drugs that are not prescription ( like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) .
depending on the planned thought of your A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in@@ fusion and / or the extent of your ren@@ al function , your doctor will tell you which other medicines you can use and when .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it , even if it is not bund@@ led with prescription drugs .
a hospital oth@@ ec@@ er , nursing staff or a doctor will mix the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA powder with a sterile 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) before it is applied to you .
your doctor will prescri@@ be cor@@ tis@@ one tablets ( according to 4 mg of dex@@ am@@ eth@@ a son twice daily ) that you must take the day before , during and the day after using A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA .
your doctor will prescri@@ be foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) to intake or mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amins which contain foli@@ c acid ( 350 to 1000 micro@@ grams ) , which you must take once daily during the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA application .
in the week before applying A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and about every 9 weeks ( according to 3 cycles of treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ) you will also receive an injection of vi@@ - t@@ amin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and are unable to lose weight after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intestine .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with placebo in 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches in the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stage lab@@ ors , stu@@ h@@ ld@@ rang , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term Mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced h@@ ep@@ atic and / or kidney function .
• Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic needs to be adjusted .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregn@@ an@@ cies in order to prevent potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international normal@@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene remain in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed after the administration of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one single @-@ use A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one volunteers .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were as@@ cer@@ tained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of adverse events known after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of un@@ defined size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obes@@ e subjects without significant clinical findings .
in most cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported cases , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ ke@@ ep@@ tive properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect occurs in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ tic li@@ ases .
clinical studies have derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a share of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 5.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo -@@ 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % with or@@ list@@ at ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo -@@ 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
with waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of a cum@@ ulation .
in a study with obes@@ e patients given the minimal systemic res@@ or@@ bi@@ tive dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 , after separation of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , which represented nearly 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the elimination of fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , since at this time you may have not consistently reduced fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week , before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them then in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial desktop , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms appear , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep it out of the reach of children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the container . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel sealed containers which serve to keep the capsules dry .

permanent weight loss , for example by improving diet and exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to nour@@ ish yourself permanently .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as an indication of the food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
what amount is appropriate for you take from the information below which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , the observ@@ ance of the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms . • You should try to decrease gradually and continuously .
34 This decreased calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg a week without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended calorie intake . • &quot; L@@ ess physical activity &quot; means that you only have little or no walk , climb stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means you can burn 150 k@@ cal by movement every day , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gar@@ dening , or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat goals and to adhere to them . • At@@ ten@@ ly is a nutritional diary containing data on calorie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .

Aloe is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies which are the moderate triggers of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in the case of chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate triggers of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for ma@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the launch of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in cases of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy as a result of cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids present before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute id should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised , however , with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi will not be used in the days after chemotherapy , nor for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor @-@ oriented activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ists examined ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron intraven@@ ous dose and a ste@@ ady st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ ine ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , R@@ ani@@ ti@@ din , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) who were at least associated with Alo@@ p@@ eci@@ a , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for an al@@ gal over@@ dosage .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were compared to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ d@@ set@@ ron who were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with medi@@ cally em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and reproduction and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted with 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron administered in I.@@ V. in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After an intraven@@ ous dosage , a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0,@@ 3 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the equivalent level ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ time dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the liver enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours of urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients , the total body number was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ wer@@ age and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and reproduction and can pro@@ long action potential .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ma ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ es ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of approval for the treatment of the drug Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal part that is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ term ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue damages damages , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further ab@@ duc@@ ted in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance .
Al@@ ph@@ eon the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that substanti@@ ate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study in patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ med@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been vo@@ iced to the fact that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients that responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical studies .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon the disease reg@@ ressed in more patients than with the reference resin agent ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected wounds ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ w@@ ed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ er@@ go may not work against this type of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients aged nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the area to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had subsi@@ ded after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo said treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin l@@ esi@@ ons , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home hours , about 90 % of patients in both groups were treated for treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the place of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ ings , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin balances the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment should be carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ol in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered when no improvement or wor@@ sen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo cannot be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Au@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment is not considered necessary when topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin balances should only be used during pregnancy if topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether to continue or stop breast@@ feeding or to continue the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effect was irrit@@ ation at the location of approximately 1 % of patients .
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ab@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ uri@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ om , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
binding on this binding site inhi@@ bit pep@@ tide transfer , partially block P @-@ binding sites and prevent normal formation of active 50s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ol with at least some forms of infection appears question@@ able , counselling should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin has been applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ allo@@ ped skin for up to 7 days .
in 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin balances twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic incorpor@@ ation in humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 separated skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ol in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive functioning of liver and thy@@ roid .
in vitro examination of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in the rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats indication of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ ewed skin ) :
in an embry@@ onic toxic@@ ity study on rats , oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , develop@@ mental toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged one to 15 years , who are not immune to these two diseases .
ambient rix is applied as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ matrix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ matrix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the registered vaccine of Twin@@ rix adults since 1996 and the vacc@@ inated V@@ acc@@ ine for children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ matrix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ matrix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
in the period between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ matrix developed a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ matrix was similar to six and a 12 month intervals between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ matrix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
ambient rix may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the marketing of Ambi@@ matrix in the whole
the standard vacc@@ ination plan for the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ matrix consists of two vacc@@ inations , the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster dose is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a booster as protection since they may be protected from immun@@ ological memory even in cases of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions following the administration of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels after the pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the administration of additional doses of vacc@@ ines can be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal success in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection routes should be avoided .
in thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , however , Ambi@@ matrix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously as it may result in bleeding after intra@@ muscular injection .
if Ambi@@ matrix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was adequate to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines in this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ cket salt and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ matrix were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ inations between 1 and 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ matrix was compared with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation based on a calculation basis per imm@@ uni@@ zation dose , but not based on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ matrix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ matrix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received the Ambi@@ matrix compared with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vaccine the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds .
the share of vacc@@ inations , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ matrix or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ inations between 1 and 15 years , ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose administered to month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study carried out in 12@@ - to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ matrix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ative vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was valuable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after dosage of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine compared with Ambi@@ matrix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ matrix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ matrix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12 to 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose Ambi@@ matrix was administered at the same time with the booster dose of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ od@@ ine conver@@ sions as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised to this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in poll@@ uted waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ matrix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even though the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines ? ( though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , has been shown to you / your child
an allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath , or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ matrix .
instead , it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before completion of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ matrix is inj@@ ected into people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have been vacc@@ inated / or have received immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ matrix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ matrix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
in general , Ambi@@ matrix is not given to pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ matrix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ iness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 inj@@ ected doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects , which were reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B , are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 in@@ bred cans ) are :

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package supplement .
ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
on the basis of the data , which has become known since the first approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP has assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ matrix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ matrix was only put into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands in May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ moun@@ ts can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ equ@@ ine en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ moun@@ ts - divided into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed with food or via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
there was no comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) .
am@@ mo@@ sis can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or flavor release , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ moun@@ ts in patients with disturbances of the ure@@ a cycle have effectively prevented high ammonia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ ola was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available .
the use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of an enzyme has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( the complete enz@@ ym@@ atic defect that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis exists .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulated form for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing .
the daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development .
according to clinical experience , normal daily dose of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ vor@@ tex bamboo .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine at a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are not permitted to admini@@ ster patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , as there is a risk of the emergence of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablet contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or serious ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and e@@ dem@@ a formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in young rats at high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it slow@@ ed down the neur@@ onal increase and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed stimulation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AU ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an un@@ intentionally single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that a nit@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced for each gram .
it is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues during the first year of life .
by hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was with time for many people with mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
survival rate was 98 % in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the or@@ ni@@ b@@ os@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with a protein @-@ reduced diet .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are rarely reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium ethylene but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
after different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable in the next morning after a ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
secre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate did not have any treatment with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who can not swal@@ low tablets , or patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing ) or have given a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to clinical experience , normal daily dose of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammonia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ am@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ vor@@ tex bamboo .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat pipes were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ) before the birth , there was l@@ esi@@ ons in the brain cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , ar@@ mor@@ ed top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
stur@@ di@@ omet@@ rically seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess fat
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which has been taken for every gram , can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible for treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon holds 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium bic@@ yl@@ but@@ yl .
when a patient has to obtain the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products which accum@@ ulate after the consumption of proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium hydro@@ but@@ yl nit@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription drug .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , follow @-@ up of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ enting , memory problems and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .

angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without a stroke ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox@@ in is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a certain dosage or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients were often employed ( a short tube which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent losing ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , angi@@ ox@@ - with or without a gift from GP@@ I was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effectively as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in with respect to all indicators , except in severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox@@ in may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union to the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ wife inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous stu@@ n of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in the second row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements .
a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given immediately before the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous stu@@ ds of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single bolt @-@ gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the stu@@ b dose should be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is over 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate @-@ sized kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) who undergo a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS or not ) .
if the ACT rate is less than 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is tested again 5 minutes after the second bolt dose .
in patients with moderate @-@ sized kidney damage , which were included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT rate was 5 minutes after applying the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe un@@ controlled hypertension and sub@@ acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if most of the arter@@ ial punc@@ tures occur in PCI patients under bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , the majority of patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform bleeding during treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine again reaches the level existing before treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) , it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are to be checked regularly .
animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , such as in the foot@@ notes of table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , which requires radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the punc@@ ture point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed loc@@ al@@ is@@ ations , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed together by system categories in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately ab@@ rupt and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific Th@@ rom@@ bin@@ der inhibit@@ or which bin@@ ds both the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because thro@@ mb@@ in on the one hand spl@@ its the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients with endo@@ theli@@ al thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mbo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent and conc@@ entri@@ c an@@ tic@@ os@@ ul@@ atory effect by prolon@@ ging the ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI is performed in the patients below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST mid@@ wife inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recurring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent a angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on quad@@ ru@@ ple and triple points of a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , thi@@ ghs or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin .
insulin lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short @-@ acting insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was established after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin elevation .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH approval for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or administered sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously by continuous in@@ fusion into the area of the stomach .
due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the insulin need in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced .
any change in the effect of action , the brand ( adju@@ ster ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 insufficient dosage or dis@@ continuation of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment is changed .
the substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , include oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic drugs , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , beta @-@ block@@ ers , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ f@@ eit regulation can be allevi@@ ated or missing under the influence of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic poly@@ mers such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reservoir .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not pass into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
following are listed the adverse drug responses known from clinical studies , group@@ ed by system categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , light he@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ ch@@ - , changes in vision , head@@ aches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Op@@ ens to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , can subsequently perform a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin takes place faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ a normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male subjects ranging from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin lu@@ li@@ sin showed a proportional , glucose @-@ lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was evident that in an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post @-@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine was achieved , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale control was achieved than with the human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is turned on 15 minutes after the meal starts , a similar gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 micro @-@ gro@@ oves before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine at least 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
