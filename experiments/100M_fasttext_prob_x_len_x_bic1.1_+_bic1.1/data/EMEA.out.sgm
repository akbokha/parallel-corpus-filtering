<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations concerning the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">For further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. chaotic thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal elation) alternate with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inhalation or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify should be removed, the dose should be adjusted to Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This interferes with the transmission of signals between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between neurons.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably acts above all as a "partial agony" for the receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazl is like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser degree than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl helps to normalize the brain's activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms was studied in three trials over to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared to placebo in two trials in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased agitation over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence in 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilised with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased agitation, compared with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the patient's symptoms were examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to intake.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg significantly increased the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In four of the five short-term studies, Abilify was less effective than placebo in the treatment of bipolar disorder.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the resumption of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to lauazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrolled access), hyperactivity (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (nausea), obstipation (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole were predominant.</seg>
<seg id="26">Moreover, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who mostly had manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">A lower initial dose should be considered with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after change of an antipsychotic therapy, even when treated with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder did not have an increased risk of suicide using Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypofolkemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelter and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia appear in a patient treated with Abilify, it should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops symptoms and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is why Aripiprazl should be used cautiously in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">In 56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma, or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical anpsychotic agents who allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydigs, polyphenols, polyphagony and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Because of the primary efficacy of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study involving healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metaboards the common application of highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 results in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metaboards.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazol or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered together with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextroomorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextroomorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">This medicine may not be used in pregnancy due to the insufficient data state for safety in humans and due to the concern in the reproductive studies of animals unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, the patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients treated with Aripiprazole received a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia, and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with opaque apine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I disturbance - in a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazl alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of hemodialysis in the treatment of overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdosing, since Aripiprazl has a high plasma protein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated on the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine D and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazl showed a high affinity with the dopamine D and D3 receptor and the serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptor and a moderate affinity for dopamine D, to the alpha-1 adrenergic and the histamine receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With Aripiprazl in doses ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, the positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent decrease of binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligand, at the nucleus caudatus and on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of respondents "response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a 26-week placebo-controlled study on stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significant reduction in the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which comprised 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed a superior efficacy compared to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosing with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies lasting 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect similar to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, in week 12, Aripiprazl showed a comparable percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a 26-week placebo-controlled study, followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl showed itself to placebo in terms of the prevention of a bipolar backlash, predominantly in the prevention of relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elioration period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabolers via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolers via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as in a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A population-specific evaluation on pharmacokinetics did not indicate clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazl were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in patients with varying liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canoic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal cortex toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas / day (equivalent to 10x of Middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was ascertained as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates in the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, in the human gall at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg. found at the highest recommended daily dose of hydroxy- Aripiprazl no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the gall of monkeys are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to Expositions of 3 - and 11-times the Middle Steady State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once clinically appropriate, the treatment with Aripiprazl injection solution should be terminated and commenced with the oral application of Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended taking care of adipous regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given based on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicine already used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If an advanced oral treatment is indicated by Aripiprazl, see the summary of the Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders that have been caused differently than schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed regarding extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (either prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be used cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypofolkemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including aczelter and maligne form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of Dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS include high fever, stiffness, changing consciousness levels and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydigs, polyphenols, polyphagony and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored with regard to a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the Sedan was greater compared with Aripiprazl's sole gift, in a study where healthy volunteers Aripiprazl (15 mg dose) were used as an intramuscular injection and the simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is not considered clinically relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') metaboards a common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as istraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose level before the beginning of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 lauazepam (2 mg dose) were intramuscularly received, the intensity of the Sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazl's sole gift.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following adverse events were more common in clinical studies with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were identified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical studies with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26,6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment was 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters emerged, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazl compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events associated with an antipsychotic therapy and their occurrence in the treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazl injection solution with statistically significant improvements of aggregation / behavioural disorders associated with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms as to placebo and similar to the lauazepam reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from baseline on PANSS Excitement Component score in the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5,8 for placebo, 9,6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed statistically significant improvement of the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52% of respondents "response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% (oral) and Haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg-Depressions-Rate-Scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a 26-week placebo-controlled study on stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) significantly reduced the decline rate, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an orlanzapin-controlled, multinational double-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients reported weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a 26-week placebo-controlled study, followed by a 74-week extension of manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl showed itself to placebo in terms of the prevention of a bipolar backlash, predominantly in the prevention of relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazl AUC is 90% larger than the AUC after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies involving healthy subjects, the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after IV application there were no safety-relevant concerns regarding maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, preclinical data did not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicological significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent non-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose for humans) and an increase in adrenal cortex carcinomas / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">Cholelithiasis was also detected as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates in the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to the exposures of the 3 and 11-fold of the intermediate steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole gift or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">In total, in the main study 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel treatment.</seg>
<seg id="270">Looking at only those patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between medicines in terms of efficacy studies such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, patients who had previously received other treatment of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood or have low neutrophils before the start of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel drugs and that it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side-effects compared to other paclitaxels.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxane BioScience Limited approval for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anthracycline-containing therapy is not indicated (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils number &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">Under sensory neuropathy level 3 the treatment must be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to degree 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate depression of the liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">No studies with impaired kidney function have been carried out and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation by paclitaxel, which could have significantly other pharmacological characteristics than other parts of Paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should immediately be removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no repeated Abraxane treatment courses should be initiated until the number of neutrophils has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the platelet number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver dysfunctions (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a causal toxicity related to Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea occur in the patients after the application of Abraxane, these can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constilling methods.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should apply a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to use no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised about a sperm conservation before treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of side effects, which occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III pivotal phase III trial.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent important hematologic toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); very rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic dehydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue heartburn, dry mouth, pain in the gums, loose stool, oophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the thoracic body, weakness of muscles, sore throat, muscle spasms, skeletal muscle pain, chest pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscular weakness. very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no causal connection was established with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicroubules ingredient which promotes the contraction of the microtubules from the tubula and stabilises the microtubules by inhibiting their decomposition.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubules network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transenic epithelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-aluminous receptor and due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumour.</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm non-verbal trials and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a paclitaxel monotherapy every 3 weeks, either as a solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as 30-minute infusion without medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy level 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for ablation of baseline because of the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the complete paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10. the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase after IV administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft tissue connection from paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to paclitaxel containing a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of a solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearing of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue histories, we report that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative intake of the unaltered active substance was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -Hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, indicating a far-reaching non-renal clearing.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available about patients aged over 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packaging instructions. • Unclear pictorial representation of the correct application of the product provided coolers for the transport by the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine, which is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood eisenic values, in which complications may arise in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donation is not possible before surgery and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">Treatment with abscamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donors Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietal deprivation or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Flamed was treated as an injection into a vein as part of a major study of 479 patients who suffered from kidney problems caused anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="370">At least eight weeks, Eprex / Erypo had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to the unamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of absentamed under the skin were investigated with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused anaemia, the hemoglobin values of patients who were switched to absentamed were maintained to the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, persistent migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Flamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Flamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union, evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces Abseamed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted the company Medice pharmaceuticals Pütter GmbH & Co KG approval for the placing of flamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of the transfusion requirement in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia following chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if bleeding-saving measures are not available or insufficient, for planned larger surgical procedures, which demand a large volume of blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopedic intervention in adults without iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may be applied which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, in which the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6,8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the doctor needs assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values above or below the hemoglobin target concentration can be observed in a patient.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should aim to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used in the lowest permitted dose required for control of anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses as patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses as patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dosage increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and follow-up may vary depending on age, gender, and total disease burden; therefore, the doctor needs assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should aim to achieve the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permitted dose required for control of anaemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the haemoglobin value has risen by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reptiles ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared with the baseline value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) and the number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl has risen compared to the baseline value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after further 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value is ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of reticululosis by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the haemoglobin value has increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of the reticululozytes by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the baseline value, an response to epoetin-alfa-therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood vessels is required, should be treated at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. several weeks before the commencement of the autologous blood donation program - so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the waveamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Here epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who are diagnosed with any erythropoetin on erythroblastoconia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not get an abscamed or other erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, instable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep thrombosis (e.g. anamnesia known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are foreseen for larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases; severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotid or cerebrovascular accident; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastoenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported about the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of effect, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reverse dose value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiumintoxicoation, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticululocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticululoyte "index"), is degraded (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic kidney failure, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit based on the administration of epoetin if the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required to control the symptoms of anemia and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically manifest coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of hemoglobin target concentration under Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which is still not dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week delay between epoetin-alfa-free and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epoetin alfa drugs.</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase exceeds 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are foreseen for larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to epoetin-alfa therapy the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially with underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that in the case of treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dL an increased risk of postoperative epithelial / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine did not prove that in tumor patients with symptomatic anaemia, they improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in people with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy was returned when haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was striven</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is applied along with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose should be adapted to the increasing haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissues, there is no evidence of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF in terms of hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurythromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">An increased incidence of thrombovascularly events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients suffering from erythropoetins.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in thrombotic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically engineered epoetin alfa is glycosilized and in relation to the amino acids and carbohydrates are identical with the endogenous human erythropoetin isolated from the urine of anaemia patients.</seg>

<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (fractures), including those who have recently suffered a minor traumatic hip fracture as during the attack; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should receive at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment. before the first infusion, patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (inflammation) shortly after the application of Aclaa can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>
<seg id="571">For the treatment of the disease Paget, Aclasta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently suffered a hip fracture; the number of fractures over a period of up to five years was studied.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in a total of 357 patients in two trials and compared with Risedronat (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that breaks down bone substance) in the blood returned to normal or at least 75% in comparison with the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of spinal fractures in patients under Aclaa (without other osteoporosis surgery) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to all patients under Aclaa (with or without other osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study involving men and women with acetate fracture, 9% of patients under Aclaa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Aclaa occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclaa must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to Zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients in Aclasta are exposed to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonnecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The Aclasta manufacturer provides information on physicians who prescribe Aclaa to treat osteoporosis, including information on how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission granted the company Novartis Europharm Limited a permit for the placing on the market of Aclasta throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • The pack supplement • contraindication in pregnancy and in breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recent low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg of Aclasta once a year is recommended for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the disease Paget, Aclasta should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After treatment of the Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily, at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclaa (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently-administered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclaa-Infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclaa may be reduced by applying paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorders (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Accredited is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclaa are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age, as data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclaa is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting the treatment with Aclasta (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid introduction of the effect of Zoledronutrient to bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclaa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget twice daily, at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental interventions, no data is available, whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclaa may be reduced by applying paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">Incidence of atrial fibrillation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients who received Aclaa (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclaa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), common (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronutrid was associated with kidney dysfunction, which referred to as decrease of the kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the Kreatinin Clearance (measured every year before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were compared to the placebo group for three years in a clinical study in osteoporosis.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase of serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclaa compared to 0.8% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium figures, which were below the normal level of the threshold (less than 2.10 mmol / l), occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Aclaa in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclaa in the Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study on preventing clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the morphological Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures following a recently acquired hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclaa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronic acid in a large clinical study, local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain were reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, via osteonecroses (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including Zoledronutrients.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extractions or other dental intervenes.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 Study with 7,736 patients showed osteonnecrosis in the jaw area with a patient treated with Aclaa and placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose leading to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by using oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7.736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-Score for the Schenkelhal ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spinal fractures Aclasta lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after a year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients from 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on acetate fractures Aclaa showed an equally lasting effect over three years, which reduced in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk for hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) increased bone density at the lumbar spine, hips, and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the whole hip by 6.0%, the neck diameter by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology at 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclaa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCAT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal Propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclaa reduced BSAP significantly by 30% after 12 months compared to baseline and was held at 28% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the output value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. orally or intramuscularly) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the Aclaa treated group, compared with 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, in comparison to placebo treatment, the BMD increased at all time points compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase of the BMD by 5.4% over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% at the total half and 4.3% at the Schenkelhal.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study were randomised 508 men and in 185 patients the BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the frequency of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclaa-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (trial CZOL446M2308), the annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior to the weekly administration of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment with the disease of the bone Aclasta disease was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, especially mild to moderate-moderate morphological paste of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2.6x to 3.0fold age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg Zoledronic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg risedronate once a day for 2 months was proven in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">The combined results showed a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain relief compared to baseline for Aclaa and Risedronat after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responses at the end of the six-month study (addressed to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From 143 with Aclaa and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response was maintained in 141 of patients treated with Aclaa, compared with 71 patients treated with Risedronat, during an average duration of the follow-up period of 18 months after application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-off and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledronutrid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">Then the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10% of the maximum after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life hours t ½ α 0.24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long phase of elimination with terminal Eliminationshalbswertime t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above ½ -values) represent the rapid resorption in the bones and excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the curve (plasma concentration against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearance of metabolized substances by cytochrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, nutrient-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the Coledronic acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine-Clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney function disorder down to a creatinin-Clearance up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of the coledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe kidney dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only contains limited data, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-Latvian intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In case studies of dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC - the 6 times the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Subchronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous intravenous application, the renal tolerability of coledronic acid in rats was administered in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose equivalent to the 6x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC, equivalent to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure, related to AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated use in accumulated expositions adequately exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common findings in studies with repeated application was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals during the growth phase with almost all doses, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the low serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronutrid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the disease Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogen made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of the Morbus Paget, the bone structure is too fast, and new bone material is structured unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclaa works by normalising bone remodeling, thereby ensuring normal bone formation and gives strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are undergoing dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclaa with other medicines please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you have taken and / or adopted other medicines, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking medicines which are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclaa together with food and drink, be concerned that according to your doctor's instructions, you should take sufficient fluid before and after treatment with Aclaa.</seg>

<seg id="681">Morbus Paget The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclaa works for a long time, you may need to take another dose only after one year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low over time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">With Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for longer than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration of Aclasta was missed, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before terminating the treatment with Aclasta If you are considering termination of treatment with Aclasta, please take your next doctor appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion are very common (with more than 30% of patients), but less frequent after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="689">At present, it is unclear whether Aclaa causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms with you after you have received Aclaa.</seg>

<seg id="696">In patients with low-traumatic hip fractures, the infusion of Aclasta should be performed two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after administration of Aclasta, patients have to be adequately supplied with liquid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the rapid settling effect on bone remodeling, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, at least twice a day 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclaa.</seg>
<seg id="700">In patients with a recently-administered low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the infusion of Aclaa.</seg>

<seg id="749">The present document is a summary of the European Public Prosecutor Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the trials conducted in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be applied alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetic drug) is not shown. • It can be applied along with another diabetic drug (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin, it can be applied in patients (especially overweight patients) who cannot be satisfied with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyor or insulin, the present dose of the sulfonate resin or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar level); this should reduce the dose of the sulfonate resin or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients, the efficacy of Actos in Tripletherapy was investigated; in addition, patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonate resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional dose of Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and sulfa drugs decreased by 0.94%, while the additional dose of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was investigated in 289 patients, the patients who increased Actos additionally to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who received additional placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were vision disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesiasthesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as part of a monotherapy (in the sole use).</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited approving Actos for the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">The tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark "15" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and metformin is unsuitable for contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at risk of developing at least one risk factor (e.g. early cardiac infarction or symptomatic coronary heart disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in heart failure reports, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be guided by the clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected, which can agitate fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution a slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparison-controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3.1-4.2% and hematocrits by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral secondary or triple combination therapy with an insulin or as a two-subject combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a diabetic macular edema was reported under the treatment of thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribing doctors should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological diagnosis should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="784">The patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if one patient wishes to receive a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reducer inhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC of Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% decrease in the AUC of Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypersensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal during pregnancy and thereby reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; common &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable in this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refraction index of the lens, as they are also observed in other hypoglycemic active substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege was more than three times the upper limit of the normal range as compared to placebo, but less often than in comparison groups with metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease the frequency of severe heart failure under pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazone or Pioglitazone respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch, it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pioglitazone, but more often when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparison media.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, subsequently 180 mg / day over seven days, no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific core receptors (PPAR-γ) activated in the animal model leading to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucosage in the case of an insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclazide versus monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8,0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years at the beginning of the therapy, a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) could be maintained by pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient to insulin were randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo in spite of three months of optimization of insulin.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to patients receiving insulin only; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, the pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetic patients for 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglyceride and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as slightly, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced total plasmatoglyceride and free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, metformin or Glicencidal.</seg>
<seg id="808">Compared to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazon, while lower levels of metformin and Gliclazide were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both with effect on triglyceride absorption and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular Outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomized to receive either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the efficacy in roughly three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been proven that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral treatment of radioactive pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma-elimination period of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the total active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies coincided with mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume augmentation with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that treatment with pioglitazone reduces the hypersensitivity and increased insulin resistance of the mother's animal by decreasing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased independencies of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other thiazolidindian led to an increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1,9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were examined with Pioglitazone or Gliclazide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, the pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of over 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride levels, both over an effect on the Tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic tryglizeride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study missed the target with respect to its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the overall mortality, non-mortal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularisation and reascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other hand the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures of randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative medicine showed an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5,1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medicine.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actrophane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks, indicating how good the blood sugar is.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c level which indicated that the blood sugar levels were lowered as strongly as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">Dosages of actrapas may also be adjusted if they are administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package contents).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Actrophane's benefits were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission granted the company Novo Nordisk A / S a permit for the placing of Actrophane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Premixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily, if a quick initial effect along with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly, for example, by an intensified insulin therapy, can perceive the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA to insulin-animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required for the change to Actrophane in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such journeys may lead to insulin and meals being used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken by them.</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycemia and hyperglycaemia, which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetic therapy, increase the risk of abnormalities and fertility in utero.</seg>
<seg id="880">Severe hypoglycemias can lead to unconsciousness and / or seizures and end with temporary or permanent disorders of brain function and even death.</seg>
<seg id="881">Disease of the nervous system - Peripheral neuropathy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort that is referred to as acute painful neuropathy and are usually reversible.</seg>
<seg id="882">5 Intensivation of insulin therapy with an abrupt improvement in blood sugar control can, however, be associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy.</seg>

<seg id="884">General conditions and complaints at the location of the surgery: during insulin therapy, local hypersensitivity reactions (redness, swelling, itching, pain and haematoma can occur at the injection point).</seg>
<seg id="885">Diseases of the immune system Occasion - Urticaria, Exanthem Very rare - anaphylactic reactions symptoms generalized hypersensitivity, including generalized rash, itching, sweating, gastrointestinal disorders, angioneurotic oedema, low blood pressure and fainting / unconsciousness.</seg>
<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can, however, develop gradually: • Light hypoglycemias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grapes, sweets, biscuits or juice containing sugar. • Serious hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect begins within half an hour, the maximum duration is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with faster resp. delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of splitting (hydrolysis) places on the human insulin molecule were considered; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended to increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuscitated according to the user manual for the first use.</seg>
<seg id="893">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="894">The doctor must therefore consider possible interactions during therapy and always ask his patients for other drugs taken by them.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data collected in two years of the open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in serum resin concentrations to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of rheumatism, so that less than 3% of patients needed treatment for a gout (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the node, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the lymph node up to 24% in 54% of the patients.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After the intake of simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5,3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) compared to those who only received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE is equivalent to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), agulence (ulcera) of esophagus, dyspepsia (swallowing problems), aborted abdomen (blower abdomen) and acidic buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3, or any of the other ingredients ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Oesophageal reactions, such as oophagitis, esophageal ulcera and ösophageal erosion, rarely followed by esophageal striktures, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partly these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible allergic reactions, and patients should be pointed out, when symptoms of malignant irritation such as dysphaggia, pain in swallowing or retrostar pain or new or worsening heartburn, seek treatment and seek medical consultation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe diarrhea side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all the dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was found, rarely (after market introduction) gastric and duodenal ulcera, including some severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonnecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen predominantly contain intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with a surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteonnecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning while taking a dose of ADROVANCE, after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week provided.</seg>

<seg id="1302">Alendronat foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate if taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking alendronate before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronat was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, which recognize embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonnecrosis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports stem from cancer patients, but also for osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum-calcium intake was up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and serum phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1318">The effects of Alendronat on bone mass and fracture incidence in postmenopausal women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design (n = 944) and fracture intervention trial (FIT: n = 6.459).</seg>
<seg id="1319">In phase III studies, average BMD ascents with alendronat 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.8% on the spine, 5.9% at the femur and 7.8% at the Trochanter.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the group treated with Alendronat, a reduction of 48% (Alendronat 3.2% compared to placebo was 6.2%) in the share of patients who suffered from one or more vertebrate fractures.</seg>
<seg id="1321">In the two-year extension of these studies, the BMD ascents of the spine and the Trochanter continued to stop; the BMD of the femur and the entire body was also maintained.</seg>
<seg id="1322">Fit was made up of two placebo-controlled studies where alendronate was taken daily (5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years):</seg>
<seg id="1323">In this study, the daily dose of alendronate reduced the occurrence of at least one new vertebrate score by 47% (alendronate 7.9% versus placebo 15.0%).</seg>
<seg id="1324">Resorption based on an intravenous reference dose was the mean oral bioavailability of Alendronate in women 0,64% for doses between 5 and 70 mg after a nightly fast and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Bioavailability correspondingly decreased to about 0.46% and 0.39% when Alendronat was taken half an hour before a standardized breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="1326">In osteoporosis studies, alendronate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1327">In healthy subjects, oral prednisone (20 mg three times a day over five days) did not lead to clinically meaningful change in oral bioavailability of Alendronat (increase in the range from 20% to 44%).</seg>
<seg id="1328">9 Distribution studies on rats have shown that Alendronat is temporarily distributed in soft tissues after intravenous administration of 1 mg / kg, but then quickly dispersed into the bone or excreted with urine.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Excretion After IV administration of a single dose of 14C-Alendronate about 50% of the radioactively selected substance were excreted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radioactivity was found in the rotting.</seg>
<seg id="1330">After intravenous administration of a single dose of 10 mg, the renal clearance of Alendronat 71 ml / min and systemic clearances did not exceed 200 ml / min.</seg>

<seg id="1402">As tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already being used in the EU, the company has presented the results from previous studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from the published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">Furthermore, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, and the use of Advagraf was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplant was repelled after a treatment duration of one year (by examining for example, how often a re-transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter further trials were carried out to 119 patients with kidney transplant and 129 patients with liver transplant and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1407">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against tacrolimus, macrolide antibiotics (such as erythromycin) or any of the other ingredients, Advagraf cannot be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Patients and physicians must be careful if other (in particular some herbal) drugs are taken at the same time with Advagraf, as the anagraf dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time needs to be adjusted accordingly.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a consequence of a switch to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level determinations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus valley mirrors should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable with both formulations in both veneer and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus Valley Mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplant under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate late transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">As tacrolimus is a substance with a low clearance, an adaptation of the Advagraf dose scheme can take several days before the steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the transplant rejection, immunosuppression has to be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dosage recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start at 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustment can be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of the patient's stabilization after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of the transplant rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should start at 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must a transplant of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily intake of Advagraf, this conversion has to take place in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After a transplant from other immunosuppressants to Advagraf once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplantation should begin with the prophylaxis of the transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">For adult patients who are converted to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with Advagraf in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients, came in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day, for pancreatic transplant recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area may require a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Because the renal function exerts no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of the serum levels of serum, a calculation of the creatine contents and monitoring of the urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Conversion from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In the conversion from a Ciclosporin to a tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the blood level in whole blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the help of full blood Tacrolimus talc controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Valley Mirror during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talents of Tacrolimus should also be controlled following conversion from prograf to Advanagraf, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or by using substances which could change the Tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the stady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the overall blood of Tacrolimus in full blood is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in the kidneys - and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus sub- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and appropriate daily dosage; changes to the formulation or regime should only be performed under close control of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be chemically resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions which may lead to a reduction in the blood lipid levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during a treatment with Advagraph (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, aqueous or septic hypertrophy designated as a cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore occur also under anagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or ultraviolet light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus can show symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered state of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medicines known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strong interaction has been made with antimykotika such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, Itraconazole and Voriconazol as well as with the Macrolid antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetics studies showed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus due to the inhibition of the gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone as used in acute rejection reactions can increase or lower the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines which are metabolized by CYP3A4 can interfere with their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">As tacrolimus can reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the level of endocrine, decisions on contraceptive measures are particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal testing have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and extend their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of patients with transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1463">Ischemic disorders of coronary vessels, tachycardia chamber arrhythmia and cardiac arrest, heart failure, myocardiopathy, ventricular hypertrophy, supraventricular arrhythmias, palpitatio, anomalies in ECG, abnormal heart and pulse frequency</seg>
<seg id="1464">Diarrhea, nausea gastrointestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal ulcer and perforation, bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract, stomatitis and ulceration, ascites, dyspeptic signs and symptoms, obstipation, flatulence, flatulence, bloating, looser chair, signs and symptoms in the gastrointestinal area</seg>
<seg id="1465">Infections and parasitic diseases such as other highly effective immunosuppressants are often increased in patients treated with tacrolimus, susceptibility to infections (viral, bacterial, mycotic, protozoal).</seg>
<seg id="1466">Cases of non-virus-associated Nephropathy and JC Virus-associated progressive multifocal leukencephalopathy (PML) were reported in patients under immunosuppression therapy, including therapy with Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors associated with treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high adhesion to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects On the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell interior.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thus preventing the transcription of a specific series of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus inhibits the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells, dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute outcasts were 32.6% within the first 24 weeks of the Advagraf Group (N = 237) and 29,3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).</seg>
<seg id="1473">The patient survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90.8% for prograf; in the Advagraf arm 25 (14 women, 11 males) and in the Prograf arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Renal transplantation The effectiveness and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared, each in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, in 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The patient survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Advagraf and 97.5% for prograf; in the Advagraf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Prograf arm 8 (3 females, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared with Basiliximab-antibody-induction, MMF and corticosteroids, in 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">Incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, corneal transplantation, biopsy confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Advagraf Group (N = 212), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraph Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4,0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-8.9%, 5.2%]) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraf arm 3 (men), in the Prograf arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus following other primary organ transplants Prograf has developed into a recognised primary immunosuppressant for pancreatic, pulmonary and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 lunglung transplanted patients, 475 patients undergoing pancreatretransplantation and in 630 cases after a bowel transplant were used as primary immunosuppressant.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf found in these published studies the observations in the large studies where prograf was applied to primary immunosuppression in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported, who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic corneal graft rejection, the bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome, was less common in the first year after the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, it occurred in 21.7% of the cases for the emergence of a Bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly larger (p = 0.02) than the number of patients encircled by Tacrolimus on Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus Group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pankreastransplantation A multicentre study with oral prograf was carried out in 205 patients undergoing a pancreatic and kidney transplant, which were randomised to receive tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the target range from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric clinical trial with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after intestinal transplantation showed an updated survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow magnification, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of Tacrolimus, which lead to bottom mirroring between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant irradiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the discounted fraction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearances observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This indicates that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion occurs mainly via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">The systemic exposure of tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraf was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf in stable patients who were killed by prograf (once daily) at a ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to conduct frequent checks of the Tacrolimus Valley Mirror during the first two weeks after transplant followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which have proven to be chemically resistant to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data is available for the retarded formulation advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, hypertension, kidney or liver dysfunctions, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed acute outcasts were 32.6% within the first 24 weeks of the Advagraf Group (N = 237) and 29,3% in the Prograf Group (N = 234).</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clutter disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether Advantages are used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clots like bleeding in joints, muscles or inner organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enables it to form the human factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advance is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is made differently, so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional trials in patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the application of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, Advate's efficacy in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood sepals was "excellent" or "good" rated.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advantages (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies to Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Lawyers must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG approval for the placing on the market of Advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) repeat until the risk for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a proper determination of the factor VIII plasma is recommended to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients can differ in their response to Factor VIII, different in vivo recovery achieve and exhibit different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.E. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to verify an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitory values it is possible that the factor VIII-therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of administration should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always directed against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma with modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VIII, where the risk depends on the first 20 exposure days and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In previously treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestically known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The ADRs, which were present in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients) who performed all previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibiting inhibitors, headaches (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-spiegels occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the time, and both the factor VIII- levels in the plasma and the Clearance-rate showed adequate levels on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed moderate to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were diagnosed with a FVIII inhibitor after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients with a current clinical study were 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to the traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titres against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1564">A patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody reflection against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms referred to an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Four patients were isolated from the occurrence of urticaria, pruritus, skin rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reports over hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactoid reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated factor VIII acts as a co-factor for the activated factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were performed in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (baseline factor of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the first approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore CHMP has decided on the basis of the security profile of ADVATE, which requires a submission of PSURs every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the official approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) to withdraw his application for Advexin's application for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is an "Adenovirus" that has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and therefore cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin should have injected directly into the tumor and thus enable cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein once more.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is formed from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient, in which Li-women's cancer occurred in the area of the lower abdomen, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP responded to the company's responses to the questions asked, there were still some questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP will create a list of questions sent to the company on day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Advexin's injection in Li-Fraumeni tumors has advantages for patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company did not adequately demonstrate that Advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "modified ingredient release" "" "" "" "means that the tablets are so composite that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal paths caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people over 12 years, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except constipation of the nose, the patients reported that the aerinaze had a decrease of the symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in the patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients with aerobaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerobaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), clogging, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolency (sleepiness), somnolency (sleepiness), somnolency (sleepiness), somnolency and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aeronaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients against adrenergic active substances or lauatadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aeronaze must also not be used in patients suffering from a lack of glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyroidism), hyperthyroidism (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission granted SP Europe approval for the placing of air in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, however it is swallowed whole (i.e. without chewing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">As a result of the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application should be as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms have ended.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, since the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease with time during long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After regression of the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with disloratadin as monotherapy as required.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aeronaze contains pseudoephedrine, the drug is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within 2 weeks after the treatment has ended.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined application of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine, ephedrine, Oxymetazoline, Napzuolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective and the data will not suffice to give appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to make recommendations for dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or amplification of headaches) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">Caution: • Patients with digitalis • Patients with arrhythmia • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deposited at least 48 hours before the implementation of dermatological tests, since antihistamines can otherwise prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">However, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of disloratadin were observed as part of clinical trials involving desloratradin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor tests revealed no significant differences between the patients treated with disloratadin and placebo-treated patients, regardless of whether chloride was alone or taken with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of disloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 is not inhibiting, and in vitro studies have shown that the CYP2D6 drug is not inhibiting and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the use of aerobaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies however did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">As reproduction studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerobaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to drowsiness which can result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible lethal processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, aggravated miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, pre-cordiale pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, blurred vision and hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia, and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both the inhibition of releasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as inhibition of the expression of the P-selecules in endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study of adults, disloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight performance including the amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 were treated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving aenaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerinaze tablets with regard to the swollen effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with disloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient subgroups defined by sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">Following the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of disloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult volunteers, it was found that four subjects were disloratadin poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction survey shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine following the exclusive gift of pseudoephedrine was equivalent to exposure after administration of an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity with repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data with disloratradin does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats at a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits at a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>

<seg id="1721">For children between six and eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the symptoms (itching, number and size of the trigles, impairment of sleep and performance during the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body has the syrup, the solution for inclusion and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius showed an average decrease of the symptom scores by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decrease of the symptoms after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>

<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to relieve the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited clinical trials experience in the application of disloratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous course of the disease and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and resumed after reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), patients can be treated during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with disloratadin tablets, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">A clinically-pharmacological study did not increase the performance of alcohol while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can come to light headedness, which may result in impaired mobility or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side effects were reported in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported in placebo were tiredness (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 youthful patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with disloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study at which up to 45 mg of disloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose) were administered.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of releasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophils as well as the inhibition of the expression of the P-Seltin molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses, which was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg. a day for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-times the clinical dose) over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, disloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flux, including the amplification of subjectively drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacriating and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">An intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall scores of the questionnaire on the quality of life of Rhino conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated on behalf of further forms of the Urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology despite the etiology of the different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recruited by a prospective prospectively.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine response is a causative factor in all urticular diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of prematitus and the reduction of size and number of squads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with disloratadin compared to 19% of those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study where patient demos were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients had a higher concentration of disloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily application of disloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the official approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company accepts his application for approval of Aflunov on the prevention of H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus spreads, which can easily spread from human to human because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system recognises the part of the influenza virus contained in the vaccine as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the virus's membrane cover with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognises as foreign body) was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">Thus, the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine did not suffice to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for vaccination vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are taking part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">For further information on the basis of CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, which are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution for intake, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Aspirin should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked which antiviral medicines the patient has taken before and the likelihood that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children between four and twelve years and for patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of asgenerase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase in combination with other antiviral drugs reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not curing AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of AIDS-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The Agenerase drug, enhanced with low doses of ritonavir, was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the viral load variation after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In studies with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml compared to placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but only very few of the children who had been treated with protease inhibitors were very few.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the Agenerase drug Agenerase increased the viral load as effectively as other protease inhibitors after 16 weeks of treatment:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients suffering from HIV, which was resistant to four other proteasinhibitors, Agenerase, together with Ritonavir, led to a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhoea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aspirin may not be used in patients, the St. John's wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are just as aspirated as aspiration and are detrimental to high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in body fat distribution), osteonnecrosis, or immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase in combination with antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1-infected adults and children over four years had outweighed the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee found that the benefits of asgenerase in combination with kritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors were not detected.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "" "" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "" "" "as only limited information was available at the time of approval." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Limited a permit for the placing on the market of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is in combination with other antiretroviral drugs used to treat HIV-1 infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic sampling of Amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of Amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, aspirin capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram basis are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying additive of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Generic ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase Capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Aspirin must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present mediums of the cytochrom P450-Isozyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aspirin or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aspiration does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver dysfunction with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information of this drug.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing hepatic liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Morbus Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking these medicines at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective due to reduced plasma levels of Amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with Amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is also given at the same time with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the possible risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolon content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aspiration should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mucous membranes participate (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or exacerbation of an existing type of diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses that were necessary to therapy drugs that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemythroses occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is assumed (including corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, heavy immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneksis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutical width are not allowed to be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present mediums of the cytochrom P450-Isozyms 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutical width Agenerase with Ritonavir should not be given together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% decrease in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">When trying to compensate the low levels of plasma by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver have been observed very often.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of Amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">When a patient receives Johanniskraut, the Amprenavirarium and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nelfinavir is given together with Amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">Up to 508% increases for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical studies dosages of 600 mg of Amprenavir were used twice a day and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily that substantiate the efficacy and safety of this treatment plan.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degraded when Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin-Values of Amprenavir in the plasma, which were reached with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg rite avir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study for use of Agenerase in combination with Didanosin, but due to the antageous component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenue of didanosene and aspiration are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effects of Nevirapin on other proteasinhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentrations of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised, since Delavirdine may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on delavirines is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193%, resulting in a rise in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose, although there is no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with asgenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to 2,69times compared to the value observed once daily without concurrent application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4, may also interact with asgenerase, possibly interact.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are applied in combination with aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on data from other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids are not taken at the same time as aspirin as it can result in absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme reductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with Amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, Isradipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nife</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent consumption with Agenerase can significantly increase plasma concentrations and strengthen with PDE5 inhibitors associated with side effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous gift of Agenerase with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, distinctive increases in the plasma level with simultaneous administration of aspiration are expected.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended as plasma concentrations of Cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, aspirin must not be applied along with orally-taken midazolam (see Section 4.3) while caution is required while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data on the simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaseinase inhibitors indicates a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam around 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered along with Amprenavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium, especially if low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the lower reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given, as the Amprenavir dosage is to be adjusted if Amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aspiration, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictably, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended by Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk lactating rats, but it is not known whether Amprenavir treats people with breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2001">During the lactation period Amprenavir was given a reduction in the 12 body weight of offspring during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of Amprenavir to the maternal animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the Agenerase treatment were mild to moderate, early on and rarely used for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of aspiration twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degrees 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, and laboratory alterations (degrees 3 to 4) were performed under the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including a loss of peripheral and peripheral fatty tissue, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsocervical fat accumulation (Stickers).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral unprocessed individuals who had been treated with Amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (Sticks) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the PROAB 3006 study, 245 NRTIs performed in Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes usually were mild to moderate markedly, erythematous or macrolopapulous nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with Amprenavir had to be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonnecrosis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pre-treated patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice a day together with low-dosed kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 to 4) and laboratory abnormalities (degree 3 and 4) were very common to those who were treated with low dosed kritonavir in patients who received Agenerase together with low-dose rite avir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdose, the patient can observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral gag- and gag-pole- proteinsions with the result of an education of non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">Antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other kritonavir treatment regimens with proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral unseen patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 out of 14 children, in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients who were not treated with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, I50V, I54L / I, I62V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice a day: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I54A / L / M / S / T / V, I62V, V82A / C / S / T / V, I84V, and L90M as well as a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always consult the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic analysis systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypic cut-offs (separating points) for FPV / RTV that can be applied for the interpretation of results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Amprenavir's associated genetic makeup creates a certain cross-resistance against rite avir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamateavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral unseen patients, in which a Fosamprenavir inhaled scheme failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance to Lopinavir and saquinavir (three of 25 isolates), Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Premature termination of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">Evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which Agenase (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly bonded with low-dose rite avir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the part study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-capsular wave of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 had been pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was examined three times a day, 20 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of kritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, about 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">19 Based on this data, the beneficial benefit of "unbiased" aspirin should be taken into account when optimising therapy with PI-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of Amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508% increased, for Cmax decreased by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given together with Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">Administration of Amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of Amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the stady State (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous eating affects the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amprenavir from the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration at the stady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">For this reason, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with aspiration (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase Capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable than the capsules; therefore, Agenerase's solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of Ritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction should be limited to the elimination of Amprenavir and Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment regimens lead to Amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those who are obtained on healthy subjects after a dose of 1200 mg of Amprenavir twice daily without concurrent administration of knightly avir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with Amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas were benign in male animals, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of ambulb.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the actual exposure data on humans, from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro genotoxicity tests, which contained bacterial cell reverse mutation tests (ames test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberration test on human peripheral lymphocytes, Amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring the AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">No significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of aspiration nor after the end of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed, which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the amplifying additive of kritonavir (booster), higher doses of aspiration (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg of Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily maximum dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">The simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Aspirin should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mucous membranes participate (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and disease-dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It was shown that Rifampicin caused a 82% decrease in the AUC of Amprenavir, which can lead to a virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">Up to 508% increases for Cmax by 30%, when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with Amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin-Values of Amprenavir in the plasma, which were reached with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg rite avir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended, as the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with Amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Caution is required when these drugs are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and kritonavir on delavirines is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin should be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31, although no clinical data is available for this purpose.</seg>

<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg of fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% -confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with aspiration, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of ortho novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ehatylestradiol plus 1.0 mg Norethindron) led to a decrease in the AUC and Cmin of Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of possible benefits for the mother compared to the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">During the lactation period Amprenavir was given a reduction in the weight of offspring during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of overdose, the patient can observe signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemp concentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM with acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">On the other hand, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the benefits of "unbiased" aspiration should be taken into account when optimising therapy with PI-treated children.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents fluctuates during the dosing interval, depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration at the stady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2089">For this reason, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 have to be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with aspiration (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>

<seg id="2095">Toxicity in young animals treated at the age of 4 days showed high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2096">These results suggest that in young, the metabolism pathways are not fully developed so that Amprenavir or other critical components of the formulation (z.).</seg>
<seg id="2097">Agenerase's solution to intake is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, proteasinhibitor (PI) -pre-treated adults and children over 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="2098">The benefit of the kritonavir "geboosterter" Agenerase solution for inclusion has not been proven in patients with PI pretreated patients or with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of Amprenavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, aspirin capsules and solution to take on a milligram per milligram basis are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to swallow the capsules (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase's solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) amprenavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2800 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, as no dosage recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of Agenerase's solution to take up and low dosed kritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although dosage adjustment for Amprenavir is not deemed necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of high propylene glycolon, the Agenerase solution is contraindicated for infants and children under 4 years of age, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Concurrent administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as arrhythmia (z.).</seg>
<seg id="2106">Patients should be advised that aspirin or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="2107">The present antiretroviral therapy including treatment with aspiration does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="2108">For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under supervision of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Aspiration should be stopped for a long time if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or mucous membranes participate (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2110">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors such as higher age, and with drug-49 dependent factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2111">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemythroses occur.</seg>

<seg id="2115">Based on the data on 54 other CYP3A4 inhibitors, significantly higher plasma concentrations of Midazolam are expected after oral administration of Midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="2116">The potential risk for humans is not well-known. due to the possible toxic reactions of the fetus it is not possible to use the propylene glycol contained in the pregnancy (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2119">The safety of Agenerase was studied in adults and children over 4 years of age in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2120">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are related to taking Agenerase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In the treatment of antiretroviral unpretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other kritonavir treatment regimens with proteaseininhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Premature termination of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2123">62 Based on this data, the beneficial benefit of "unbiased" aspirin should be taken into account when optimising therapy with PI-treated children.</seg>

<seg id="2192">In cases where such reactions emerged at the outcome of the urethra, some women had difficulty passing urine, requiring emergency catheterisation and treatment of the affected area.</seg>
<seg id="2193">No clinical experiences are available for the application of iodine iodine-cream directly after a treatment with other cutanally applied means for the treatment of external seignies in the genital and perianal area.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Although limited data indicate an increased rate of inclination reductions in HIV-positive patients, Imiquimodine-creme has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group with regard to the elimination of the nipple warts.</seg>
<seg id="2195">Treatment of basal cell carcinoma with ismiquimod within 1 cm around the eyelids, nose, lips, or hair approach was not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are frequent, but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions proceed after completion of the treatment with Imiquimodine-creme.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary because of the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As there is currently no data available about long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs do not have clinical experience, therefore the use in previously treated tumors is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical trial indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) a lower probability of response to Imiquimodine therapy exists.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Ismiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip level.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratoses on anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness in this use, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with Imiquimodine-creme.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort for the patient or are very strong, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 acute lesions showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immuno-stimulating properties imiquimodine should be applied with care in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) can be quantified neither once nor after repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events and possibly with the application of imiquimodine-cream related side-effects in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions in the place of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imictorimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine-cream related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Basal melanoma patients treated with Imiquimodine-Cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial reported adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common adverse event, as probable or possibly associated with the application of imiquimodine creams, was a response in these studies (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of Phase III with Imiquimodine-Cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The review of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine-cream normal skin reactions including Erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excoriation / flattening (23%) and edema (14%) occurred (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs planned according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with Imiquimodine-cream, severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and too heavy flocculation and calming (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actinic keratose alopecia was determined with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg of imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could result in nausea, vomiting, headaches, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, was found in hypotonia, which normalized after oral or intravenous liquid return.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic examination systemic concentration of alpha interferons and other cytokines was detected after the topical application of ismiquimodine.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy in relation to a complete healing of the nippines in an imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of patients who were treated with Imiquimodine, patients were completely cured; this was the case in 20% of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimodine, compared to 5% of 161 male patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine during five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically healed and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hyperkeratotic, non-hypertrophic nuis- lesions within a contiguous 25 cm2 area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications for external genital warts, actinic keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and therefore have not been examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Creme was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies with children aged 2 to 15 years with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimodine could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks, respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic inclusion of the 5% iodine iodine iodine cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 single bags), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated obvious half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-time after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this points to an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of Imiquimodine after topical application on MC-infected skin of patients aged 6-12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at the rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application, also carried out for four months, yielded no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study on the carcinogenicity of mice in malignant administration three days a week did not induce tumors in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only has low system absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for humans due to systemic exposure is considered to be very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in greater number than in the control group with lower UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can harm other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. − If any of the listed side effects are significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="2244">If untreated, it can lead to distortions, especially in the face - so early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who were exposed to sunlight during their lifetime.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be applied in case of flat actinic keratoses in the face and on the scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Creme supports your body's immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body combat the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for infection.</seg>

<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning under the foreskin is not carried out, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty in pulling back the foreskin can be expected with increased appearance of constriction.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not apply Aldara cream in the urethra, in the vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within the anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other drugs have serious problems with your immune system, you should not use this medication for no more than a treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have intercourse with genital warts in the genital area, the treatment with Aldara cream after sexual intercourse (not before) perform.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use other medicines or have recently applied it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not breastfeed your infant during treatment with Aldara cream because it is not known whether ismiquimodine supersedes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment are different in cases of prevalence, basal cell carcinoma and actinic keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin place with the warts and gently rub the cream on the skin until the cream is completely absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with warts under the foreskin will have to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you need to consider before using Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Apply a sufficient amount of Aldara Creme for 6 weeks to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too much to the treatment with Aldara Creme, you should not continue using the cream, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A lower number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infection; it can cause you to develop a blue stain quicker or cause fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may feel itching (32% of patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas on which you have applied Aldara cream (8% of the patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions, which end up again within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment has stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Occasionally some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, vaporisation, skin disturbance, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, sensitivity, swelling, small swollen zones in the skin, tingling, vapour or discomfort), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, clogged nose, diarrhea, actinic keratose, redness, facial swelling, ulcers, limbs, fever, weakness or chills.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, aggravating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">Administration of aldurazyms should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need medicines prior to administering to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness was also measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the concentrations of GAG in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children reported a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), feeling of heat, fever and reactions to the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are elevated blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measurement size of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever, and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to larvonidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year any new information that may be known, check and update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will monitor patients who receive aldurazyms regarding the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. a permit for the placing on the market of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO-mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been established, and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect related to infusion or until the end of the infusion (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of aldurazyms should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment in which revitalizing facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the clinical phase 3 study, nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against Laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the resumption of treatment after a longer break, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions following an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously avoided due to the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with drugs (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to treat the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of moderate or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have decreased, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 are (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate at which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interfering with the intracellular intake of larvonidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, including embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is available to newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were classified as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3- study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions including bronchospasm, respiratory failure and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Interactions associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years, with predominantly severe course form and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Most patients were treated with a serokonversion within 3 months from the beginning of treatment, with a seroconversion usually within a month under the age of 5 (average after 26 days vs. 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or until early retirement from the study), no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it was never before seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with out-of-the-low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG level in urine, while patients with high antibody titres showed a variable decrease of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal or low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larva activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies seemed not to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy lies in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated sub-stratum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, Laronidase is quickly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via male-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited to study the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients had a mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited when they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected feeder and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement in lung function and the ability to walk that is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group, as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically insignificant over this period and the absolute lung volumes increased proportionately to the height of growing children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a significant decrease of the GAG mirrors was found in the urine (µg / mg creatinine), which remained constant up to the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">There was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A single-year open phase 2 study was conducted, investigating the safety and pharmacokinetics of 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study (16 patients with severe form and 4 with mean follow-up).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dose was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased levels of GagA in week 22 during the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of progression (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe traverse form limited or no progress in cognitive development were to be determined.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacogenic effects of various aldurazyme dosing regimens were carried out at the GAG mirror in urine, liver volume and 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can represent a justifiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical efficacy of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that is available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity in one-off administration, toxicity with repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2345">If you use Aldurazyme with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medications containing chloroquin or procaine, because there is a possible risk of reduced effect of aldurazyms.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have taken other medicines or recently taken it, including prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Instructions for handling - thinning and application The concentrate for the production of infusion fluid must be diluted before application and is intended for intravenous application (see information for doctors and medical professionals).</seg>
<seg id="2348">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can, if the patient tolerates this, gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-I- conditional participation of upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, however, severe reactions emerged, including bronchospasm, breathlessness and facial oil.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence at more than 1 of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • rash, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • reddening • increased pulse • hypertension • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that is available annually, and if necessary, the delivery document will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not used immediately, it should not be stored for more than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, if the dilution is under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2353">Preparation of an aldurazyme infusion (by means of aseptic technique) • first determine the number of fluid-thinning bottles to be diluted according to the body weight of the individual patient.</seg>
<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another anti-cancer drug) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is probably easily spread to other parts of the body. • advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squamous cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with Cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, a "anti-emetics" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids (to prevent liquid deficiency) should also be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood type changes, or where certain other side effects occur, treatment should be postponed, lowered or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of telemetremixed thus slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetreem into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In a major study, Alimta was examined in 456 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease in a major study.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another cancer drug), both in combination with Cisplatin in 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months in the single administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months for docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells did longer survive in the administration of Alimta compared to the comparison agent.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. a licence for the marketing of Alimta in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle of carbon dioxide must be dissolved with 4,2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is taken from the bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is shown in combination with Cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant plate-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of surface area (KOF) is administered as intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion over a period of 2 hours approx. 30 minutes after the completion of the telemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously as an intravenous infusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroids must be given the day before and during the day of the telemetry treatment as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake should be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) during the week before the first telemetremixed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetremixed, a complete blood pattern should be created before each application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place taking into account the nadir of the blood-image or the maximum non-hematologic toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recuperation, patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 which apply for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients develop non-hematological toxicity ≥ degrees 3 (except neuro-toxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if a haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or so- at the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies have shown no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, in comparison to patients aged 65, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data about safety and effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, patients with a creatinine-clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min did not require dosage adjustment that could go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was insufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; to 1.5 times the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or transaminase levels of &gt; to 3.0-times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with regard to the immunosuppression and Pemetremixed must not be administered to patients before their absolute neutrophils number has again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the platelet cell counts again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-hematological toxicity observed in previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 haematological and nichthonous toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neutropenia was ob- bated when a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with telemetric acid must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid simultaneous use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and acetylsali- cyllic (&gt; 1.3 g per day) for at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with a Pemetremixed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetremixed (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion before the telemetremixed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetremixed occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">As the possibility of an irreversible damage to reproductive capacity exists by means of Pemetremixed, men should be advised to obtain advice regarding the preservation of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal renal function (creatinine-clearing ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g per day) can result in reduced emetremixed excretion as a result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">This is why caution is required if high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses are used in patients with normal kidney function (creatinine-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy, on the day of therapy and least 2 days after therapy with telemetremixed are avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with PemetreFixed for at least 5 days prior to therapy must be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with Pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetremixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- and antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Telemetremixed may not be used during pregnancy except when it is essential and after careful consideration of benefits for the mother and the risk of fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">As the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is caused by Pemetremixed, men should be advised before the start of the treatment to solicit advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed into breast milk exceeds and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby can not be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and were randomised Cisplatin and Pemetremixed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomised to receive Cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2427">Clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of Coli- tis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal transit, intestinal necrosis, and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">From clinical studies, patients with telemetremixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It has been reported in cases of acute renal failure in telemetremixed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis in patients reported before, during or after their telemetric treatment were reported (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is an antineoplastic antifolate which exercises its effect by interrupting important, folate-dependent metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as an anti-folate with several points of attack by blocking the thyme dylatsynthase (GARFT), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the follower-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomized, simple-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin with malignant pleural othelioma showed that patients treated with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had a clinically significant advantage over patients with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the investigational arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural othelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin-Arm (212 patients) compared to the sole Cisplatin arm (218 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2507">In the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no relevant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily patches in the anus, flatus (winch) with stage labors, stuhldrang, oily / oily chair, oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be used in patients suffering from a long-term Malabsorption syndrome (in which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease) suffer, and in pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 body mass index) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under the age of 18, as insufficient data is available for efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly and patients with reduced hepatic and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic monitoring, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of the antidiabetic needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should consult their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted.</seg>

<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin, a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-Values (international normalised ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotene remain in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">A marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed after the administration of Amiodarone single-use Amiodarone volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug because the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were ascertained from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on the available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events known after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events have voluntarily been reported by a population of undefined size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days at normal and obese subjects without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In most cases of orlistat overdose reported cases, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of possible systemic effects caused by orlistat's likeeptive properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect occurs in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of gastric and pankretic liases.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have derived that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, has blocked the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a share of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% with orlistat (baseline 5.0 mmol / l) and with placebo -2.8% (baseline value 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% with orlistat (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo -3.8% (baseline value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">With waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma could only be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of a cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with obese patients given the minimal systemic resorbitive dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1, after separation of the N-molyl-leucine group), were identified, which represented nearly 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding Corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active substance prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate causes of nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In the case of chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223) compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In the case of chemotherapies, the moderate triggers of nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189) compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron, these values were 63% for maxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>

<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in cases of highly emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy as a result of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids present before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients with amnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute id should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advised, however, with simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with whom the Qt interval is extended or which tend to be an extension.</seg>

<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicine) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, Chlorpromazine, Chinidine, Ranitidin, Ritonavir, Sertraline and Terbinafine) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">The use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used for pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) who were at least associated with Alopecia, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post-marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effective relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, dialysis is probably no effective therapy for an algal overdosage.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide (half-life time 7.3 hours) were compared to day 1 without Dexamethasone intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, a total of 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg Ondsetron who were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with medically emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable to the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and reproduction and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted with 221 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of the Palonosetron administered in I.V. in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After an intravenous dosage, a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionally in the whole dose range of 0,3 90 μ / kg in patients and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34% between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to the equivalent level (AUC0- ∞) with the one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the one-time dosage of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites that have less than 1% of the antagonistic effects on the 5HT3 receptor compared to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, are involved in the liver enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron approximately 80% of the dose were found within 144 hours of urine, Palonosetron as immutable active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy patients, the total body number was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal Eliminationshalbwerage and the average systemic exposure to Palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block in very high concentrations of ion channels, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and reproduction and can prolong action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose met in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasma (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal mares) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for the human being.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report, in which the approval of approval for the treatment of the drug Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal part that is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-term) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue damages damages, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) are further abducted in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Alpheon the manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that substantiate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study in patients with Hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference resin to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>

<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been voiced to the fact that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients that responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon the disease regressed in more patients than with the reference resin agent; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine) is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected wounds (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because alergo may not work against this type of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients aged nine months, but in patients under the age of 18, the area to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had subsided after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo said treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin lesions, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home hours, about 90% of patients in both groups were treated for treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (stained cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the place of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small infirings, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted the company Glaxo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing on the market of Altargo in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In case of sensitization or serious local irritation by using Retapamulin balances the treatment should be stopped, the ointment should be carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections where MRSA is known as pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies with secondary uninfected open wounds the efficacy of retinol in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered when no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of Retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations which were achieved in humans after topical application on abraded skin or infected surface wounds, a clinically relevant inhibition in vivo cannot be expected (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2-times daily 200 mg ketoconazole, the average Retapamulin AuC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamulin ointment on skinned skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dosage adjustment is not considered necessary when topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin balances should only be used during pregnancy if topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether to continue or stop breastfeeding or to continue the therapy with Altargo, it is necessary to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Altargo, the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the location of approximately 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation of Clitopilus passaberianus (formerly Puriotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosom, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in ribosomal protein L3 and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding on this binding site inhibit peptide transfer, partially block P-binding sites and prevent normal formation of active 50s ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retinol with at least some forms of infection appears questionable, counselling should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains should be considered with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin).</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% Retapamulin has been applied daily under occlusion to intact and scalloped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">In 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin balances twice a day for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic incorporation in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 separated skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinol in human liver microsomen was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, under low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive functioning of liver and thyroid.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In vitro examination of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rats-microkernel test for in vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats indication of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skewed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryonic toxicity study on rats, oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3-times of the estimated human exposure (see above), developmental toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambient rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged one to 15 years, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambient rix is applied as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambimatrix can only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desired for hepatitis A or B, Ambimatrix or other hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act by contributing to the immune system (the natural defense of the body), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">After a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as "alien" and produces antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambient rix contains the same ingredients as the registered vaccine of Twinrix adults since 1996 and the vaccinated Vaccine for children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambimatrix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambimatrix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentrations a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In the period between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children, Ambimatrix developed a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambimatrix was similar to six and a 12 month intervals between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambimatrix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, maturation (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambient rix may not be applied in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the marketing of Ambimatrix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan for the immunization with Ambimatrix consists of two vaccinations, the first dose at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster dose is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the appropriate monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vaccination need a booster as protection since they may be protected from immunological memory even in cases of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of anaphylactic reactions following the administration of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In case of hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels after the priming, so that in these cases the administration of additional doses of vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal success in the gluteal muscles, these injection routes should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In thrombocytopenia or blood clots, however, Ambimatrix can be injected subcutaneously as it may result in bleeding after intramuscular injection.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambimatrix was administered in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was adequate to all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it must be assumed that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines in this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thicket salt and preservative formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines Ambimatrix were administered to a total of 1027 vaccinations between 1 and 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, the tolerability of Ambimatrix was compared with the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and maturation based on a calculation basis per immunization dose, but not based on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambimatrix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in the subjects after the administration of a dose of 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had given Ambimatrix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable high per proband (i.e. over the whole vaccination cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received the Ambimatrix compared with 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The incidence of severe pain and maturation was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combined vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year vaccine the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed when administered with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported in the 6- to 11- year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The share of vaccinations, which reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambimatrix or during the 3-dose vaccination scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen, was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at vaccinations between 1 and 15 years, seroconversions for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Seroconversions for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose administered to month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study carried out in 12- to 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambimatrix and 147 were given the standard combinative vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was valuable, the Seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after dosage of the 3-dose vaccine compared with Ambimatrix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambimatrix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambimatrix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction observed in this study was comparable to that detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12 to 15-year-olds, it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme to the in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose Ambimatrix was administered at the same time with the booster dose of a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and 8 haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar Seroprotection and Serodine conversions as for the earlier formulation.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus-containing foods and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways, such as swimming in polluted waters.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, a pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may necessitate a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambimatrix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even though the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vaccines? (though you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If an allergic reaction to ambient rix or any component of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic), has been shown to you / your child</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction can be expressed by itching skin rashes, shortness of breath, or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B, if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual scheduled dose of the second vaccination).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambimatrix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, it will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of active ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection before completion of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambimatrix is injected into people who suffer from severe blood clotting disorders, under the skin and not into the muscle. • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defences, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambient rix can be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have been vaccinated / or have received immunoglobuline (antibodies) or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambimatrix, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambimatrix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">In general, Ambimatrix is not given to pregnant or nursing women unless it is urgent that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambimatrix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>
<seg id="2796">If you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination, talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2797">♦ very often (more than 1 case per 10 injected doses): • Pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Matiness • irritability • headache • lack of appetite</seg>
<seg id="2798">♦ often (up to 1 case per 10 injected doses): • swelling at the injection point • fever (over 38 ° C) • dizziness • gastrointestinal discomfort</seg>
<seg id="2799">Other side effects, which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B, are very rare (less than 1 case per 10,000 inbred cans) are:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These comprise locally restricted or prolonged rashes, which can be itching or vesicle-shaped, swelling of the eye contour and face, difficult breathing or swallowing, sudden loss of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambient rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">On the basis of the data, which has become known since the first approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP has assumed that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambimatrix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambimatrix was only put into circulation in a Member State (in the Netherlands in May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammounts can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperequine encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammounts - divided into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed with food or via a gastropostomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">There was no comparative study, as Ammontaps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo (a placebo).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammosis can also lead to loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or flavor release, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammounts in patients with disturbances of the urea cycle have effectively prevented high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">Ammonola was approved under "exceptional circumstances" due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this drug was available.</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients in which a complete lack of an enzyme has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (the complete enzymatic defect that manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use when hyperammonite encephalopathy in the anamnesis exists.</seg>
<seg id="2815">AMMONAPS is also available in granulated form for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to clinical experience, normal daily dose of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caramyl phosphate synthetase or ornivortex bamboo.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine at a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets are not permitted to administer patients with difficulty swallowing, as there is a risk of the emergence of esophagulcera when the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each AMMONAPS tablet contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium hydrobutyl nitrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used in patients with congestive heart failure or serious renal insufficiency as well as in clinical conditions associated with sodium retention and edema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate in young rats at high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), it slowed down the neuronal increase and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed stimulation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AU) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an unintentionally single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are accompanied by the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity with intravenous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is similar to phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that a nitrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine is produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that diagnosis is made early and treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues during the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium benzoate, sodium benzoate and sodium acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartal (but within the first months of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of hyperammonite encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was with time for many people with mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Survival rate was 98% in patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the orniboslase deficiency), which recovered from hyperammonite encephalopathy and subsequently treated with a protein-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are rarely reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatically with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium ethylene butyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and repeated doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polybutyl butyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After different doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) phenylacetate in plasma was detectable in the next morning after a nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium polybutyl nitrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma level were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Secretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to approximately 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus test results, sodium-phenylbutyrate did not have any treatment with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who can not swallow tablets, or patients with difficulty swallowing) or have given a gastropostomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to clinical experience, normal daily dose of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight more than 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of caramyl phosphate synthetase or ornivortex bamboo.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium hydrobutyl nitrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat pipes were exposed to phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrate) before the birth, there was lesions in the brain cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18 year old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, armored topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Sturdiometrically seen is phenylacetylglutamine comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for the elimination of excess fat</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that acetylacetylglutamine, which has been taken for every gram, can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium polybutyl butyrate in granular form 15 minutes after ingestion, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon holds 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium bicylbutyl.</seg>
<seg id="2863">When a patient has to obtain the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium hydrobutyl nitrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products which accumulate after the consumption of proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium hydrobutyl nitrate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2866">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you may not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine can pass into breast milk and harm your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases, confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, follow-up of hearing, disorienting, memory problems and deterioration of existing neurological conditions have also been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you notice any of these symptoms, immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2870">If you miss taking AMMONAPS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal.</seg>
<seg id="2871">Changes in the blood-image (red blood cells, white blood cells, thrombocytes), decreased appetite, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, stomach ache, vomiting, nausea, constipation, unpleasant skin odor, rash, kidney dysfunction, weight gain and abnormal laboratory values.</seg>
<seg id="2872">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this information.</seg>
<seg id="2873">You may no longer use AMMONAPS after the expiry date specified on the container and the container after "Used to" specified expiry date.</seg>
<seg id="2874">How AMMONAPS looks and contents of the package AMMONAPS tablets are of whitish color and oval form, and they are provided with the embossing "UCY 500."</seg>
<seg id="2875">30 If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium hydrobutyl nitrate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies.</seg>
<seg id="2876">If you are taking AMMONAPS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other medicines or recently taken it, even if it is not a prescription drug.</seg>
<seg id="2877">You should take AMMONAPS on the same single doses orally or via a gastric fibril (hose that runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach) or a nasal probe (hose, which is led through the nose into the stomach).</seg>
<seg id="2878">31 • Take from the container a heaped measuring spoon granules. • Use a straight edge, e.g. a knife bridge over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess pellet. • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon. • Take the recommended number of measuring spoons granules from the container.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without a stroke (an anomalous measured value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angioxin is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the efficacy of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angioxin was compared with a certain dosage or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients were often employed (a short tube which remains in the artery to prevent losing), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, angiox- with or without a gift from GPI was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or one year as effectively as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin with respect to all indicators, except in severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angioxin may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other hirudine or any other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had a hemorrhage, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval for the marketing of Angiox in the entire European Union to the Company The Medicines Company UK Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST midwife infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous stun of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is performed in the second row, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken up for 4 to 12 hours according to clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">A bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is to be given immediately before the procedure followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of Angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous studs of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and one immediately subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single bolt-gift from Angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted medicine should be carefully mixed prior to application and the stub dose should be administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is over 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">A lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate-sized kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) who undergo a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin against ACS or not).</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT rate is less than 225 seconds, a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT is tested again 5 minutes after the second bolt dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate-sized kidney damage, which were included in the phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which led to approval, the ACT rate was 5 minutes after applying the bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adaptation at an average 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous administration of non-fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low-molecular lifting.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to disturbance of hemostasis and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and subacute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if most of the arterial punctures occur in PCI patients under bivalirudin, the majority of patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can perform bleeding during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalirudine, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivalirudine again reaches the level existing before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregates), it can be assumed that these active substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregations or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are to be checked regularly.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Animal experimental investigations are inadequate in relation to the effects of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalidatine plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivaliruine group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding, such as in the footnotes of table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bivalirudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bivaliddin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, which requires radiological or surgical intervention, hematoma with a diameter ≥ 5 cm at the puncture point, reduction of haemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed localisations, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, there were more frequent adverse events in women as well as in patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less often than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped together by system categories in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately abrupt and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific Thrombinder inhibitor which binds both the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin, regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin, and thus its effect, is reversible, because thrombin on the one hand splits the binding of bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum from patients with endothelial thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce platelet aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, bivalirudin shows a dose-dependent and concentric anticosulatory effect by prolonging the ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI is performed in the patients below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, non-fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST midwife infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomized to receive a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before the start of angiography (at the time of randomization) or at the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly over the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had a recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent a angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day and the 1-year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or prior to the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel prior to angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito-neural, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, which decreases the hemoglobin mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple points of a randomised double-blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angioxin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing cutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivalirudin as peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid components with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through Thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is performed in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional safety pharmacology studies, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks from exposure to 10-times of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was confined to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to longer-term physiological load in response to non-homeostatic coagulation were not observed after short exposure similar to those observed in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the ready-to-use solution is 17 out of controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Angiox is a freeze-dried powder in single dose throughputs from type 1 glass to 10 ml that is sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sealed with a cap of pressed aluminum.</seg>
<seg id="2949">5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given in a water bottle Angiox and gently swivelled until everything has dissolved completely and the solution is clear.</seg>
<seg id="2950">5 ml are taken from the bottle and diluted with 5% glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml (0.9%) Sodium chloride solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5mg / ml bivalirudin.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children over six years of age with diabetes who need insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thighs or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short-acting insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study of 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to work effectively, Apidra was studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study involving adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was established after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin elevation.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, lowering the HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra in comparison to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Germany GmbH approval for the placing of Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or administered subcutaneously by continuous infusion into the area of the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose-ogenesis capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the insulin need in patients with a restriction of the liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change in the effect of action, the brand (adjuster), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 insufficient dosage or discontinuation of treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances which increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the propensity to hypoglycemia, include oral antidiabetic drugs, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salizylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of the adrenergic counterfeit regulation can be alleviated or missing under the influence of sympathetic polymers such as beta blockers, clonidin, guanethidin and reservoir.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general, insulin does not pass into breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Following are listed the adverse drug responses known from clinical studies, grouped by system categories and sorted by decreasing frequency of occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual creation or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, light headedness, excessive hunch-, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Opens to continuously change the injection area within the injection area, can subsequently perform a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by means of intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that subcutaneous GA- be of insulin lulisin takes place faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu- mana normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male subjects ranging from 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus, insulin lulisin showed a proportional, glucose-lowering effect in the therapeutic relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was evident that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before meal a comparable post-randiale glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">In 2 minutes before the meal, insulin lulisine was achieved, a better postprandiale control was achieved than with the human normal insulin which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is turned on 15 minutes after the meal starts, a similar glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 micro-grooves before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisine at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin lulisine at least 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
