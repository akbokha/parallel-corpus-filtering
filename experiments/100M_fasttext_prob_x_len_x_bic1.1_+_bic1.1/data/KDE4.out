package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them more readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in features you can find in the manual to &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; choose Set@@ ting extensions ... Open the box tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard setting modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed , you may need more modules on your system .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click on Tools Cancel . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if available .
the module approach filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or menu bar under Extras An@@ gle Fil@@ ters . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , choose Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default , the display starts with the root tip of the document , for example : docum@@ ent@@ Element , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in presenting ne@@ sted hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose area is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be detected even then easily if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap presentation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color combination and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over View color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used ( and hence , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) .
in case of Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , it is not always observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of the entries , and these boxes need space that is then no longer available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame if the rect@@ angle is square .
how to divide the area of an entry for subordin@@ ate entries , the implementation is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive divisions .
you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View for area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras picture gallery ... or with C@@ trl + I .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; working together .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use this to view , comment , rate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens that can be searched .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvements .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests .... This opens a dialog with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list is spoken English , you should be powerful this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ tization ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to get involved is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you first start , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can enter a local , remote or removable folder here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data logger is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a collection of images on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . while browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ kam ; recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . you can do this by inser@@ ting one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon . more details can be found in the albums section .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you can work with it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported tube cameras in the Help menu support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ .@@ More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system is digi@@ ti@@ zed ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera then appears as a disk device . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digi@@ kam ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which is a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and are slow transfer via the serial port , this connection is now out of date . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the thumb@@ nails reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nail images may not be seen or the generation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to do &amp; digi@@ tization is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ v@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures work everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ thic , over the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords , time list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to select the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio
the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter on the fil@@ en@@ ame only works if this ind the symbol view is also shown . which fields are displayed , you can configure in the dialog box settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides a organized view on your photo albums . all photos that are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums may be sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created . the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collections from the collection . if you want to add or delete collections , you can do so in the collections settings .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the oldest , average , New Year &apos;s buttons : these put the date on the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file in this folder will instead be used .
if you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview , select it . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window . album collections have a different effect . they can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview window , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using Extras View all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information about each image will be shown below the appropriate preview . which information is , you can edit settings , change it . select the albums page and adjust the thumb@@ nail area to your preferences .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter at a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all about &amp; digi@@ kam ; works . albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose any features that have been edited , using the contex@@ tual menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between viewing pictures , sli@@ deshow or editing of images .
you can open the picture editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the right mouse button and selecting Edit ... in the Edit menu . image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of Open . for this , and how to customize these to your needs , if your program is not listed you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing , other image editing programs may cause problems with the image containing in the picture . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image . this way , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . keep in mind that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the garbage bin by &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete it , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&amp; quot ; My Data List ; organize your photos on the basis of data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed to you .
photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos tagged with this keyword will be shown .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ ste@@ quot ; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are saved in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as &amp; digi@@ kam ; the images are noticed .
you can add new keywords by clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you click a new keyword after you click on an existing keyword , this will become the sub@@ keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard it . then appears a menu that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
in order to be able to use it with keywords , you first need to provide your photos with keyword . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you wish to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; Drag and drop there . alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select cue from the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords associated with it . in this way , you can receive a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have completed a photo with keyword , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu Remove . the menu shows you only the keywords associated with the photo .
the time beam view displays a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection box can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time unit .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will then appear in the list below .
includes all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next he search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search is found . if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search is performed . the Save As text field will be used to assign a name to My search list . if you want to change your selection after the search , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit the search , the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information you previously entered . if you select as an advanced search , the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for the search . see the Advanced search tool for more information .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete from the Search context menu .
advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added line by line , separated by operators . each option can be associated with others via logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ erts the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere along the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then this will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : free hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ kam ; find the matching pic@@ s . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl + L The light table added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you preview the preview from the toolbar and perform the Zoo or move operations on one of the images , then these are also performed on the other image . you can thus compare the same range of the two images .
another mode is better suited for quickly sorting out of a series of images . if you use p@@ airing from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields for comparing . use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right pane . this simplifies the work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal fire actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file edit ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swivel the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the preview mode , both pictures will show the same image area .
the zoom function works just like in other views . just use the zoom @-@ knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , protect , protect and re@@ use photos . we focus on the procedures for digital photographers which digi@@ ti@@ ze ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimizing , waiting and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a certain photo longer without inventory management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use digi@@ kam ; . the approach to save metadata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast search and secure archiving for you to freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point .
maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub @-@ folders like &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend to save the metadata option in &amp; edited the metadata on the settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? that &apos;s why &amp; digi@@ kam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , ann@@ ot@@ ations and a rating to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense , since you can focus on the best photos in further work .
now let &apos;s talk with keywords , keywords , how you frequently refer to other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . re@@ organizing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very crude representation , since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you begin to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Al@@ lied &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . w@@ ow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you might even hear the silence .
for others viewing your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate interest . if you want to show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help him over the motif that you have moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ tization ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . if you export your pictures in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
the possibilities of explo@@ iting ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will be deep@@ ened in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips using images with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps Viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and writer ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples for this can be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note on the author field , this must be filled in as well .
publishers ( syn@@ onym for vendors ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the photographer is a stock photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they offer no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery firm , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they have to be cau@@ tious and you can &apos;t believe them for more than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliably .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control hum@@ ming mechanism to protect . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a reasonably priced program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications read out corrupted disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
do not forget to copy the media with a description , date &amp; author , and then store on a clean , dark dry and in front of animals shel@@ tered place . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep track of their statistics for themselves . their production warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives : disk Study
in short : dis@@ cos are the longest in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically with lower temperature tures . electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT can not detect these errors . this is especially read errors and publishing counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
during most electric devices electric sho@@ cks don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware design , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs some of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar . remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for over@@ voltage protection , be sure to comply with the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the connected devices .
since over@@ voltage can be used for each cable to your computer , you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms since it can also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the modem &apos;s protection .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . some models allow you to keep your data stored and run in order . if you purchase a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power failure with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should be checked in reality first .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ safe .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you one day open a photo and this is to your surprise . no one ever seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard under a GP@@ L license .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss for the not@@ ebook and 46 % in the workplace systems . in case of not@@ ebooks , the proportion of th@@ ef@@ ts amounts to 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems : false , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dened file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
digital cameras sensors are 1 @-@ 2 stops of fundamental physical limitations . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ apixel resolution sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ size sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make no one responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year . so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , sharing disks or res@@ izing hard drives .
suppose you make every day your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you have luck when the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . don &apos;t forget aviation disaster : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , to the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , there is a common reason for a loss of data despite f@@ use of panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several snap@@ shots . you can restore the original state at any time that such a backup has been made . this backup comes with an unver@@ sion@@ ing system next with the exception that is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled ft@@ p sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical media .
this approach leaves you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you will get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keeping , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be taken into account :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature you have to look at everything that is said today with care and review it while time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to have a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . all the 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by means of the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory , and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the printer expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new record :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ db , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # operates with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . PNG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment for hetero@@ geneous platforms . the draw@@ back is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely distributed as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files . a problem is , however , that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a ro@@ yalty @-@ free and open source format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers already provides D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Ex@@ tend Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data in a file itself . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your image , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adapts to it as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera medium , you can use it as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for a more sophisticated editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ kam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again , which may have been cut off by the other programs .
protect the copy@@ righ@@ ted images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ In the Adding a photo to an album , you will find a description how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ databases .
to use your digital camera with digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished -@@ indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata met@@ a shows the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then downloading All . this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New Download is available . these images have not been digi@@ ti@@ zed until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you use the All downloads or download Sel@@ ected , a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are filed . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Album section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ kam ; load the photos from the camera into the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by using the Del@@ ete button . if you only want to delete some , you must select them first and then use Del@@ ete Sel@@ ected .
please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . the photos will not be moved to the garbage bin by &amp; k@@ de ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in &amp; k@@ de ; if you want to delete the camera file completely , you should do so via the camera menu , since this is much faster .
the file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names , if you upload photos from different recording series to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub@@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two are the data about the author in the standard auto identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % -@@ % d % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download it . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ kam , uses for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use any information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more about the information that your camera embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and when your camera does not supply this information , you can set the photo in its original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select Automatic Rot@@ ary in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made , you can use it to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally off , and in that case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos are directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the option Date @-@ based sub@@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , &amp; digi@@ kam asks you where to upload the images . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser that displays the area with a click . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ ist ; users who want to locate the location of the photos , or simply want to document just this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , se@@ at@@ posts and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic assignment ( manual ) and last about manual entry of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
the download of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script working with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; change . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu ; set up . the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing will be set . you will thus set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; fix if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s foot@@ er : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be labels such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the one that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency , such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here because they should en@@ umer@@ ate the picture other &amp; quot ; an@@ offer@@ qu@@ ot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image , and not only in the Edit &amp; Edit Database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; edited without going lost .
save image labels as embedded labels ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG pictures : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures .
the Settings page contains all the information that appear when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; edited ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in one &amp; digi@@ kam ; Al@@ bum@@ folder that has none of these extensions will be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; ignored .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the refresh button to the right of each category .
the brightness of the &amp; quot ; can be set on this page . however , if you then open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on if possible . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can obtain better results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in the image processing , this picture mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation .
with the PNG compression option , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this decreases the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the Def@@ l@@ ent algorithm works loss @-@ free .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning process .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was just an image viewer for photos . at present , it quickly develops into a tool to manipul@@ ate your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensi@@ tively to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels of odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the picture a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is used only if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , so the parts of your images are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights , as they display cris@@ p white . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it displays the highlights in various ro@@ ses . last , you can try some parts of the missing information from the highlights to re@@ construct .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not vibr@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should be individually adapted for each picture .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it a bit higher than the standard 1 , but this can be done later in the Edit &amp; Edit menu options ; to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo @-@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ rap@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . but it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ dient correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ask when a picture is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start .
color profile folder Sets the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ kam ; then examine this folder while starting .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are just your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color @-@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . at this time , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma doesn &apos;t adjust for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you have to do the mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which allows you to em@@ ulate how your image would be given back from one device . this is very useful before you can print image , since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not in Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface you can work digi@@ ti@@ zed ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short instructions .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the sli@@ deshow settings should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture display mode . at the moment , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage devices are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field will only be active if you have a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify here the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able where you mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ kam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window &apos;s cameras . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving images to the tr@@ ash bin , you can preview &amp; Edit images in the tr@@ ash bin . when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the del@@ eting of a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be applied tac@@ itly by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without asking questions . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also em@@ bed the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam ; at startup , this speeds up the boot procedure of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
the setting Bei@@ m Start after new photos is for@@ cing &amp; dig@@ ging ; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ kam asks you to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the toolbar design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , please refer to this tutorial for more information .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use this to view your photos and start correc@@ ting and improving . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry Show / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore button from the File menu or Rest@@ ore the Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any action of image editing can be rever@@ ted or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit rever@@ ting or Rest@@ oring by selecting Edit Res@@ etting from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should use keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl + -@@ Z to und@@ o and C@@ trl + -@@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back or restore button in the toolbar at a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can zoom in and out in the picture by C@@ trl + mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you get into the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . if you do not want to , you can also edit this in the Edit dialog . if you do not want to , you can view this in the Edit dialog . see the section on setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can choose to print image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire pro@@ positions . all image preview pages can be printed out of your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the menu Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the panel has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in the picture editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear again into the margin .
in the label view , you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the re@@ mark below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the labels are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the App@@ ly button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
in addition to the application button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files , but this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting which is always written in the pictures .
the rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images simultaneously , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Re@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords employed in this &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; session used .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword you enter . you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set in the tree by selecting the corresponding check boxes . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - dates , keyword and searches . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also pull and drop keywords . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main screen to provide you with keyword . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry searching in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :
why are Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution .
this article / Tut@@ orial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly applied it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result .
if your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image issues are via email or the web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should I use another color space and make thoughts about color blur@@ red ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , then visit Bruce Wy@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sound my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must sound your monitor since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ it@@ or is on s@@ RGB . if you are working as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , then you either need to use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alization , level@@ ing , automatic level@@ ing and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the most . you &apos;ll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the intensity values over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
same : this method adju@@ sts the intensity index of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram range .
bro@@ aden the contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a re@@ plen@@ ishment of all values in between . this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited because over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color is worked . if you can get too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better off .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu entry Color White Balance of Image Processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
in the upper right corner a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play An@@ stat with the above checks , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set you can save to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high quality pictures . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the color @-@ color correction menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and also allows you to save them for multiple photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction . in the manual for sound correction you will find more information .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
this &amp; digi@@ tis@@ ation ; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect of when one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash and then completed the development of the image . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial negative of the picture . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers .
the Ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der refresh the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can use to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you use the button O@@ k and you are applied .
if you can make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse issue : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool scale correction is located for the improvement of the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the area of the sli@@ ders for the application purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn is to move the knob and to make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image . on the left side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it can be set whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values .
the three colors can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively change output values as in the input values . e.g. , the compression of the output values can be used to create a burned @-@ out image as background while something else is in the foreground .
automatically : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . in addition , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , media and sun@@ shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below is an example of adjusting input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) .
on the left side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module :
beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible . for images with large ranges of a constant color , linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , e.g. the bright notes , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels get darker .
preview the original photos is a red marker . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and Load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sunny tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if you find more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; Edit Channel Mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of Image Processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed for comparison to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for the module are lower right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to turn on lumin@@ ance , the picture will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space . colour space consists of small space art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can save you later and then load them . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator checks all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is stored is enabled . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portrait to the sky . so , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ ge@@ Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscape , maritime scenes and air photos .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic sky effects and simul@@ ates mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
this is very similar to the process of the ble@@ aching of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ qui@@ ath@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with &amp; digi@@ kam ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tri@@ dimensional structure of the texture on the picture .
a paper tex@@ tured effect was applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; add tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you insert the desired frame type for your picture . the picture is surrounded throughout with a coloured line and Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , folded it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the width of the frame is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into one image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text alignment , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with &amp; Edit ; Tool Tem@@ plate you can apply a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . you must , however , take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; sten@@ cil database , just send an email in English to the &amp; digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you must set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that mirrors the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder will update the template of the template automatically .
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button reduces the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blur@@ ring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ acousti@@ cally . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process has to combine colors with minimal differences to a color dot . this in turn results in sharp edges a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for the private user .
in JPEG pictures often a camera has been used internal sharp@@ ness . pictures in the raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers already apply a sharp@@ ness filter during the read@@ out of the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . this allows you to use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ted Do@@ ing .
you should avoid this carefully since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is re@@ focusing the tool . you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than sharpen@@ ing it . use the tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft drawing and experiment with some settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ less mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove sli@@ ders from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tested first . an increase in the radius or the amount will ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the Un@@ shar@@ per M@@ ask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates will generate close to sharp edges .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen images in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft altern@@ ation between the tones are exemp@@ ted from sharp@@ ness and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
this &amp; Edit ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing re@@ focuses a picture by enhancing the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ le@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is the use of a blur@@ red mask . re@@ focusing mostly results in better results than blur@@ red mask . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image editing .
in practice the circular folding works much better than the pal@@ atal cle@@ av@@ age . the Gau@@ ß &apos; folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pix@@ el@@ ae that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna in@@ verse of the pal@@ atal cle@@ av@@ age is even heavily influenced by the distant pixels , causing unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should result in 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , and eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will s@@ me@@ ar the image even further .
pal@@ atal sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is Gau@@ ß . this is most often caused by a previously executed un@@ sharpen@@ ed filter . in most cases , you should refra@@ in from using this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the die can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all cutting , color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere . the reason for this is that a lot of operations do not immediately make visible changes that are not immediately visible , but which later leave un@@ pleas@@ ent art@@ ef@@ acts .
when you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , blur@@ red mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king used a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
even under optimal conditions , the result of the FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the blur@@ ring mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better when processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focuss@@ ed image :
the original blur@@ red color image needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focuss@@ ed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for error correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the sli@@ der controls the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains various def@@ aults as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to fine @-@ tune the filter settings , you can use the Tab@@ s smo@@ othing and Advanced Settings .
detail@@ ing p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a uniform smo@@ othing over the picture . whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and have details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise , a high value will generate wa@@ vy @-@ like patterns . JPEG &apos;s art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated with a value near 1 .
smooth@@ es &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a van Go@@ gh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angular step width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles make a long run time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integrated stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal , but it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to skip it .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts from e.g. dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor rau@@ ts from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gran@@ ular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool .
you will find a complete description of all parameters in the following . in most cases , you will need only the sub @-@ window details and the Advanced Settings Window for Advanced Settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius is smooth@@ ed over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor defects cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter is looking forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : adju@@ sts edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , it is not possible to remove the entire noise or noise . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak diamond or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ act without losing any details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either colour or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically smo@@ k@@ ed@@ . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : adju@@ sts the adjustment of the phase grid atten@@ uation . this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering range respon@@ ds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high a s@@ me@@ aring can occur .
store and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool for sof@@ tening with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft drawing and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digi@@ ti@@ sed images . the smo@@ othing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the contents as it also makes the human eye .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG isn &apos;t perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save As and Load buttons make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photograph that was scanned with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
this &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove photos that have been created with a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode , since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixel quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and loads it back to the next session .
the image area and preview help to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels at a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels at a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , ie under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead , they drop the edges and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 for aperture filter , which may increase the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should , also use with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise un@@ sharpen@@ ing effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color gra@@ dient of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ correc@@ ts the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the gra@@ dient correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter . the default density is 2.0 , which compens@@ ates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance of a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the gra@@ dient correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the sli@@ ders only provide positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the correction of the vig@@ nette applied to the image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distor@@ tions can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree handles the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient fourth grade correc@@ ts the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . with negative values , t@@ onal distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the strength of distortion fourth grade . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the center of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the reverse sign of the parameter &apos; General &apos; .
zoom : this value re @-@ scales the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
brigh@@ ten up : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box shows the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the sound or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . the best way to perform this correction is first . if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ne correction the effect would be obvious to the fal@@ low .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove this with the trimm@@ ing tool in the Trans@@ forming Tri@@ mm@@ ing from image editing or via the Zoom controls of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as shots from front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating inf@@ ra @-@ red film from the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web site that can be reached under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview you can set two parameters set movie gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of the movie gran@@ ules and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , because the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter In@@ gre@@ dient is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers ming@@ le large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambi@@ ance of everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the regulator can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brush is better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the machining is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel big picture is 1 and fl@@ atten 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regulator sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; Filter Grav@@ ur character@@ ises your picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; Filter Grav@@ ur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure , in which color is not the most important thing in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , dar@@ ing landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look like it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects take long time to compu@@ te and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Un@@ shar@@ pen effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom In@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ ring the image along star shaped lines that originate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radial bl@@ ur : blur@@ ring the image by rotating the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to generate the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to step back into the background .
blur@@ red vision : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear motion , z : B : taken from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ red blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or to add a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ aker &apos;s sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image through random shifting of the pixels and simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color pool in the image and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photograph into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ate it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm created by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can keep with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . after you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of rain@@ drops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can use it by mirr@@ oring or turning it into the correct orientation . you can find the tools in the Trans@@ form Turn or Trans@@ forming Spi@@ der menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job here . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . choose to change the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to magni@@ fy a small picture with a better quality then try to blow up the tool .
many image processing programs use some kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm picture bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below :
preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a van Go@@ gh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any photo magni@@ fication can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ate is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button termin@@ ating .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle . you will see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be trimm@@ ed by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . create a new rect@@ angle by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ trl + + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save in the File menu to save the newly added photo .
in the preview area you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved .
in the tool Accor@@ ding to the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is always assigned .
cutting the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches , or any other physical size . you can , for example , see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the chosen relation and orientation .
when you use the trimm@@ ing tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the trimm@@ ed image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help enable you to hide Help , so that you can put together your pictures better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third angel , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in a similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divide is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle .
the golden center provides more fluid help lines when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ party rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way .
a further rule are the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to generate the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this something can be simply there without guiding the eye , it will accomplish its task .
the golden tri@@ angles are also derived from the golden spiral below . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonic tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diagonal on these lines can be released a static object dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect called dynamic Sy@@ mmet@@ ry . try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic parti@@ tioning .
with the button color you can set the color of the guide lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast , the guide lines can be invisible . this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it happens easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are turned by an angle . you can fix this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image editing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . using the Pre@@ ferences button , you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown to the right .
for your help , the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the Trans@@ forming Tri@@ mm@@ ing function from image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function . choose one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the turn . however , keep in mind the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival trans@@ formations are performed at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically re@@ comp@@ uted . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels .
angle at the top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the trans@@ form@@ er@@ ted area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the trans@@ form@@ er@@ ted area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the trans@@ form@@ er@@ ted area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the trans@@ form@@ er@@ ted area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
the Sch@@ ering Tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the picture is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
rotate your image by sh@@ ear@@ ing the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the sea , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is mostly negli@@ gible , but two shots generating twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sc@@ aring , the image has nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is to cut the image with trans@@ forming cutting from the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats .
because of this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF below .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats that know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you will edit the file in image editing . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept change . in the Configuration section , you will find more information on this .
nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras allow you to even select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . this reduces redundant information so as to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss@@ less when specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read in English under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the Configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file , Edit ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies use to start the program to play .
go forward to the previously visited album in the Chron@@ ic@@ le . you can only go forward once you have gone back .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the white balance module .
many tools you need to edit your photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; included . your description will follow here .
all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ness , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , blur@@ ring , etc . . use a uniform dialog type that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ ear ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ exposure and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and drop it in the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo Properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this assumes , of course , that your images contain ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pallets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the dialog box you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is displayed as a line in the pallet view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described in the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select a selection . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor back there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box when the cursor is enabled under the button color , the color will be inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ writing is selected , you can select this mode by selecting the Over@@ write check box under the cursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the copying , cutting and past@@ ing actions .
&amp; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for clip@@ board data : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line end character if another color follows . if there are three figures in the clip@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit ; .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ Graphi@@ vi@@ z ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program included , are ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ print@@ Viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ print@@ Viewer ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; k@@ ates ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and returns to &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ not ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component
load large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
additional required software : &amp; k@@ table viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs .
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ table viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list Rec@@ ently opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file is changed from another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose to re@@ charge the graph or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ print@@ Viewer ; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ print@@ Viewer ; set up ... , see also .
when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; c@@ graph@@ ing ; -@@ Inst@@ all , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or from the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ table viewer ; or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog .
with the program start you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both save as well as change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
if you use multiple pages , you can select whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be incorporated into this page . in doing so , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the particular parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , and eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or query the program each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session administration page gives you the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally . you can set a default behavior ( open or not the files of the last session or not ) or specify to be asked for each start afterwards .
the context menu , which appears normally with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ N , opens up additional possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Lay@@ out@@ algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of aligned graph@@ ene . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ coated graph@@ ene . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm produces a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for un@@ coated graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ chter@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .

the K@@ IP@@ I module reading images provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video streams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
when you open the File menu item , a dialog box appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer . select here the source you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ ru@@ it values in order to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the range to suit your needs before you scan the image by pressing the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower right corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
after scanning the scan button , wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by pressing the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after clicking in the Import / Screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen fot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay highly enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog box of the target image appears with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , show photos of your camera &apos;s mobile and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the Export module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication so that it is your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful login the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after a successful login .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the Ex@@ por@@ tiere module is launched to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which shows the current access permissions that the module displays . at the moment , the module does not support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button can add photos once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file cho@@ oser box . if you click on the O@@ k button , start up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you change the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the pictures . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data are stored in the EX@@ IF tags of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinates system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data , you need a GPS trace as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical Loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS trace .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the dialog above appears then . to get a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you must load a track file with GP@@ X file . this file of course contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time vari@@ ance indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add it to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next one you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the relevant region and enlarge it . repeat this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be manually selected . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the exi@@ gen@@ ool is used to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Image Gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs to customize the settings . the tab selection allows to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ preview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , eg ; D@@ exter@@ show
the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all of your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the standard color depth , which naturally also influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nail allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during creation . the web browser will automatically end up to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming , or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is shown as full@@ screen mode by default . this can be changed to a win@@ dow@@ ed mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing pictures without affecting your quality .
this module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. in PNG format , for example .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the Metad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata . the data will be copied after you have pressed the OK button .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please refer to exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transfer . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV files .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module from Tools MPEG slide show .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to playback the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep as the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences , you can start converting the movie with the encoding button . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a note appears that coding or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck Pack@@ ages using the button settings on the bottom right .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same , and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use them elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is wor@@ sen@@ ed . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you select JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Ex@@ it information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Exec@@ ute button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all the images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize the image or enlarge it . in addition , four types of image changes are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to customize your image to screen size .
non proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
pre @-@ print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images selected by you . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . the last selected image will display a preview on the right .
you can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button Remove Images select the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you have selected are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used again and again until you change it .
select your E @-@ Mail Client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after adding comments to an attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached .
the PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format , then the original copy data will be added to the pictures you send .
when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the C@@ lose button , you can close this window .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions like you want to have displayed your sli@@ deshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant video transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , as otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt it with Es@@ c .
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . thus , the order of the images is not used in the album .
between the images , the distance between the images can be set . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images chooses another effect .
during the sli@@ deshow , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn it on .
with this toolbar you can stop the presentation and restart , jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as background for your K@@ DE work surface .
once you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can create with &amp; k@@ photo album ; by these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , thus in persons , places and in group keyword records are present .
in the browser window , you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have added your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for yourself .
when you press the mouse with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see the picture .
if you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed . by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . they can store with &amp; photo album ; however , for each person a separate preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself .
to view images next to the names , select the button on the right @-@ hand side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you have to select which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do so , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( described in more detail ) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu . here you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you enter the search in the main window , you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string into the lab@@ eling or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total dat@@ as , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are m@@ apped .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ color album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the &amp; k@@ photo album &apos;s home page and watch the Quick Start , screen@@ shots , and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ color album ; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry k@@ color album ; -@@ demo . then , some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ color album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , please visit the homepage of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , as a co@@ hesi@@ ve HTML document for downloading .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
each bar displays a different unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries Pre@@ view view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview preview ) and furthermore the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line , i.e. the time details . if you select an area , you will be displayed in the preview pane only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar .
&amp; k@@ color album ; provides two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures . one is in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; photo album is described ; integrated version described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you have to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout , and target . in the following , each area is described more closely .
first enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; photo album ; export file is to be created on the overview page .
finally , you can choose which information you want to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are currently being exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not dealt with specifically .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images , so those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 does not need to download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
once you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start once the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you specify here should be that folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub @-@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . in this , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo album ; you may , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent quite a lot of time on viewing the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do with &amp; k@@ photo album ; this work does not even make this work .
with &amp; Photo Album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are imported and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file only a link to images is located . the advantage to save all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can pass this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are found in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images , which can be accessed from the File Ex@@ por@@ tation menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three options are available :
with the Manual option close to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Import menu ... select , &amp; k@@ color album ; the exported database as described in the description .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the imported images should be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to import ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to import and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database . an example can be seen in the image .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you see pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups . if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps from ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos with one .
&amp; photo album ; saves all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; photo album ; re@@ mark the folder in which your images are stored and automatically used it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ color album , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ color album ; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained to you .
to the left , you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and see the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option .
it was described in detail how to define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
click on the dialog which is used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in the Options dialog you have already mentioned sub@@ categories . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section .
in the list below you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ color album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be called through the modules menu . the modules can and are not described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo album ; they are sold separately . however , most modules have a help page , which you can call via the module itself .
since the modules are shared by several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ color album ; therefore , you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures . demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; k@@ Photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu .
the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ color album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : even if &amp; photo album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order for albums so you can use the features with &amp; photo album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ color album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment .
in addition to the current album , we have to give the modules a list of albums . here we go with a photo album , as follows :
if &amp; photo album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , you will do &amp; k@@ color album ; so do so if you have selected persons to view and pass on this to the module .
since some modules with &amp; fa@@ Photo Album are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select which modules you want to load .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . at the moment , there is not very much information , as you have not yet received any information about your images . in the section we will return to this window , but now click on the image that shows you an overview of all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown in the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
in view , you can see three lists with a text field by defining characters , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ color album , since you will always use them whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and pic@@ tured on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by shifting the names used to the top , find and assign persons more quickly .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon on the list below .
if you have selected comments for each picture individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and provide them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click the above and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image to the top right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S. , and San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California .
on the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a super@@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special icon is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it an sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that gives you among others the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide the window . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the Display images in your browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have no filter . see here . you can configure the thumb@@ nail size by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview preview . simply select the respective images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit selection menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ color album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; photo album ; namely , images too , without having you saved on your hard drive . of course , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so &amp; photo album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images , in which the right upper corner is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , this can be seen in pictures 1 @-@ 9 . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can preview these pictures . however , you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into it . so , if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the jum@@ per of your images , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it .
in the Image menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end ones you want to make in@@ accessible and click Current View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also lock all the images that your little sister can see , navigate and lock the menu entry All out of the current view .
so you have set which images to hide in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry Add images , so that all the images you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the images again displayed , click lock .
it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the pictures . to set up this password , simply select the password in the File menu .
please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo album ; not very familiar with the view to private pictures .
the reason you are all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to see them some@@ time . for this reason , you have a picture _ and video viewer . this allows you to start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you in . he obviously shows the picture , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , e.g. who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the info box on the top part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene selected .
if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by jumping the picture up and down the image . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ B album ; then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . start and stop the sli@@ deshow by pressing C@@ trl + S .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; k@@ photo album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer will use the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button you can zoom in again with the mouse . the Plus key zo@@ oming in the center of the picture . shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the point key , you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ ation button sets the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out are with the plus and minus @-@ key .
use the context menu to turn the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item ann@@ ot@@ ations from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view further images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add all of them at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you can display categories in the front view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database .
in order to complete the Pain@@ ting Mode of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ Album , select On the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following pop @-@ up menu appears to allow you to choose the correct position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already includes the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as pres@@ etting the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a point of view as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the viewing stage selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window configurations and easily switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the beginner in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left at the bottom line .
to close a view click on the small cross in the first bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any location .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... Save . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed .
to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon The symbol Ren@@ ders in the toolbar or choose the menu entry View scene .
render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or in the View R@@ ender Mode menu ... , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub @-@ section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties , the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
when you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is split again and again depending on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam of pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 will be calculated , at a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are tra@@ cked individually and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on j@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental characteristic of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflection is calculated . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays did not hit the object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly quit , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select the Import menu entry ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings appear when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this includes the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually , this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set here the path to your retention and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you also need to add the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions .
cross extended projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you cross walls , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you cross soil , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors .
if you tick edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ modes section .
on this page you can change existing window configurations or create new window configurations . in the section window orders , it is explained how you can create and save window configurations .
the standard window arrangement : shows all existing window configurations . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the existing window arrangement lists all existing window configurations . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be created by the button Add and delete selected views with the Remove button .
with New Col@@ umn , create a new column on the right of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tabs you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available icons of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit . that means you now have a scene with no objects .
the wire model view shows just how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of rendering the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; find more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later guides , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired place .
if you press the App@@ ly button or Enter the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ less Body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ ly or Enter key . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also shows the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the level expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object . you will see then the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first choose the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something multiple .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can choose how to insert the object . please choose first sub @-@ object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = floor pigment ) , with a click on the thumb@@ nail preview you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet . therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you preview not a color on the Qu@@ ader and Ball , click the App@@ ly button and then call the preview .
the material for the floor is now adjusted correctly . if you now render your image with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree select each time mon@@ och@@ ro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the App@@ ly button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you shifted the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already in the ground , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose first sub @-@ object and change the name for example in Ball Pig@@ ment . click on Sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press the Enter key .
the gloss effect and reflection gives rise to partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromed surfaces , even when metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . any changes since the last saved version will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last returned command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edi@@ ting Un@@ do .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you can find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option pre @-@ set short instructions for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to pre@@ tend harsh surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in either a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files you can click with &amp; L@@ MB ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or if all images always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , just type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .

in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - and over@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , providing you with important information and actions for the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the picture editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and store images .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and store images . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving .
you can check the status of the support of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to select the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options in particular .
to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if Save As before saving a preview in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog with the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the way &amp; channel ; images can be selected . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog box in front of each scanned image . if &amp; channels ; this is automatically saved with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it by pressing the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images automatically to be stored and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved picture gets a numerical su@@ ff@@ ix that is automatically counted when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you select not selected the image quality then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the button Help starts K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE Via dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to exit .

Select .
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ short instructions . thus , you make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can usually be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependen@@ cy . please check your script to see if all the required modules are present and use c@@ dialog for the user to know why a script is not running .
start include &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error Error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; #
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and ste@@ er Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in every K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . usually the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . to do this , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it .
configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be saved .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; use D@@ CO@@ P functions to query more information on the new piece ( for example the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths controls the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also given , so that the script can be used to remove the cli@@ cked entry . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal is sent to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do , for example , clearing up data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such pack@@ ets are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name as e.@@ g ; amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the amar@@ oc@@ script creation . for that reason , you should name your script packages properly .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .

access similar performers : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list with similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok just needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a little guide on how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager bin@@ ds the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ escal@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will provide for example trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ del@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by checking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
usually this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will crash when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d , turn off automatically if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by E @-@ Mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens on a crash ) . if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a @-@ Info , but they do not mark as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the status bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Rep@@ lication / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the icon effects in the Control Center under App@@ ear@@ ance icons . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting displays its effect .
if you get this error : cat@@ amar@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : UN@@ DE@@ FIN@@ ED symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ 2000 pixels ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any dup@@ lic@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first .
most installation problems are most easily explained by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or from developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please make only one mistake there if you want to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only a blank playlist . how do pieces of music come into it ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the interface more intuitive , the Start sub @-@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist title of the playlist and select column Show . you can also use the short@@ instructions Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select Remove from Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would make it with other files . that &apos;s that simple : - )
in the playlist toolbar , next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is located . click on it .
probably you lack the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ dbf , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in the context menu ( accessible through the right mouse button ) . you can also find it using the menu bar under Extras equ@@ ali@@ zer ....
none . yes , that really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be what kinds of media supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support virtually any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may be ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which the default does not include MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer device with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for AL@@ SA ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to provide another sink ( e.g. , for example , in a sink ) .
do not forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Sound Server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buff@@ ers in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ ads react the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ex . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . follow the log register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then , run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the kernel @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start Now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a list of suggestions / wishes , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets you start playing Amar@@ ok ; make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; run before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the soft sounds of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you &apos;re on a different computer ?
if there is a functioning SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current play : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable username Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace the IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button turns a piece in the queue into the queue . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does it look with the icon in the Control strip system section ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS @-@ drive . after starting Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what then ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with several folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &apos; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , write an &apos; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( Esc@@ aper String ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically , this fits the previous assessment with a decreasing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has any individual evaluation on the overall result .
you can add the rating for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . there you can select the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by right @-@ clicking on the piece and selecting Edit : select an evaluation or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the rating in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that K@@ DE packages have a fixed publication plan that is not to be put together with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users may also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . choose Set@@ ting Up Settings ... and make the desired changes there .
download a Design , or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance context browser design , click Add New Design ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation Pan@@ e allows you to monitor and monitor &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you would like to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and also caused a lot of bug reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine has not compiled these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you have to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to compile and install again .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get the no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , even though the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also has to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module .
you will get the present is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then execute it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up the Amar@@ ok settings ... Audio output will enter the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
intel@@ pp@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ v@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the configuration dialog from x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not continue to be cared for . of course you are welcome to take this issue by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new so urgently needed car@@ egi@@ ver for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant that will be displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like to update your collection afterwards , or simply don &apos;t like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up and Amar@@ ok ; set up in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very easy . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . the small text box for filtering the collection makes it easy to search for certain pieces . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it to the playlist by using the button . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the files of your collection , and you have enabled the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . by right @-@ clicking on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and press the button playback .
the audio CD function uses the Audi@@ oc@@ d protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click with the right mouse button on one entry and follow the burning menu . you have here different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; pres@@ et the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . additionally , some additional pack@@ ets are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you also need to install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important features . additionally has a playlist that is superior to all the others . the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection .
this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including the creation of a collection and a playlist .
the Player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play or the current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current play . a click on this area changes the display of the already el@@ ap@@ sed playing time to the remaining play time of the piece .
in addition , the Player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button .
the Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ fying window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed under the running text display . button PL activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the playlist window while the E@@ Q button is used to set up equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to adjust the play position or volume . with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play .
using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio operators . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classical to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use Tools E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you mark the equ@@ ali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players . it has many features that are not available in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of features cool off , they &apos;re all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be split into two main areas , on the left is the navigation pane . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . the playlist is easy to use , but even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context browser displays various information about the current piece . its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub @-@ windows will be explained later in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the Start window will drop . the information shown there will now be distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the information can also be viewed in the Statistics window ( Tools statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running song , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . the title contains the name of the piece , the artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you can find more information about the current piece . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time as well as its rating .
to view cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current one . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information should be displayed in the music sub@@ window . with the right mouse button click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work up and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing . you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the text sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . once you click the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which one to start .
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . there is no running text script required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com named after the lyrics for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Artist / Album - At first the pieces are sorted by artist and below is another split after the respective album . if you want to see compil@@ ations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers .
group@@ ing Artist / Year - Album - S@@ ort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but it is additionally sorted by album below the artist .
with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine group@@ ing exactly as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection field , with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . you can also select your entire collection , which makes the filter shut down practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This lists the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play .
app@@ end to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . double @-@ clicking on an entry will give you the same effect .
set the pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces to the media player in the queue to transfer them to the media player . see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned as either data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option will not be shown .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( n ) Move files to the tr@@ ash bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it will appear among different performers .
picking up a compilation mark - Change a record marked as a compilation back to a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under different performers , but again under the corresponding performer .
the play@@ lists browser provides easy handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists .
the lower part of the play@@ lists browser includes the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created Smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , it needs to be listed in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorts in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the disk connection for your iPod .
below the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is useful especially in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than it is in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case , holding the Shift key may be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them . once you enter the letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed , which contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms separated by spaces , you will search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three .
if you enter OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing whit@@ esp@@ ace , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : assessment : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variations as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key and then click the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order . the entries will then get a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left you find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore , allowing you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar there is a unique , enlarged Analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one shown in the player window over the right mouse button . through this menu you can set up and Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example ren@@ dition checks and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of each piece . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by double clicking in the corresponding display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu .
a click on this entry opens the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what to view in the cover administration . choose from :
the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this function you have even more control of the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , the playlist will appear in the list next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already present ( the details on how to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection , adding more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( earlier : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to play this dynamic playlist .
double @-@ click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances !
the two pres@@ et modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix immediately complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist Rec@@ ei@@ vable plays start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New Fil@@ l button fills the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the corresponding settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist , but the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . if the setting is active , however , the played pieces will be removed , taking into account the played pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist so you can easily see which pieces were recently played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist according to each played piece . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings have already been described in the previous section . on the left of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick more than one playlist , you will be able to add random tracks from each of the playlist &apos;s selected play@@ lists .
some scripts allow you to customize your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and clicking on it .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts by clicking the script . it will open a selection dialog where a script package can be selected for installation . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .
if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . then select the script to be deleted and then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Writ@@ ing of Scrip@@ ts .
the dialog window visualization plugin is used to enable the available visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to track the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box in which you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that you will get a po@@ orer quality when encoding for MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created from a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog which looks like this :
in this dialog box , you can follow the progress of the copy process . once the original image is scanned into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to burn the data .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a single run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; offers , and extends these functions even . therefore choose &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . in the Internet , such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and encoder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it supports currently MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is possible , for example , to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert and convert between various audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you will need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ A : a full range of functions for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , this can be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums may lead to the un@@ nice effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu includes a list of these projects . click on one entry to open the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Ke@@ ep under will appear with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
save all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project changes and hasn &apos;t been saved yet , asks &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then choose between saving and change . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it as if you had called for each project file C@@ lose .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project is asked what to do with it as if you had called the C@@ lose file .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the Add Files dialog . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD .
opens the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium causes . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described via the What is that ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes files from a previous session to be imported into the current project . this is useful when one compil@@ es files for a multiple session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this feature is not used . it is intended for you rather than help in order to see the files and folders already present on the medium .
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
open the CD @-@ copy dialog . it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without the project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you then later burn . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows you to create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn later . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . additionally , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form .
opens the dialog for del@@ eting a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which completely er@@ ases the contents . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously selected DVD video can be converted to this dialog . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Table of Cont@@ ents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings , and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents are shown in the Table of Cont@@ ents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the Content View lets you select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ board has no real function , it only looks pretty and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change the keyboard layouts for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the allocation of keys to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator privileges are required so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is intended for custom@@ izing and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more comfortable program k@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , therefore your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the accompanying programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features like copy@@ CD , format@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects .
project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( C@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively one can get a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project received by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) void containing void add@@ ā@@ le ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string parent ) void rent ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String Quart@@ z ) void set@@ ups id ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts the files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ Price Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der review d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der review / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; audio @-@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read@@ er for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be audio CD ; s can be read and stored in mp3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; audio @-@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders who encoding these WAV files ( compression ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These Ko@@ di@@ erer packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats like the loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this needs to be done now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . however , all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to install the Ko@@ di@@ erer packages that are needed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction to encoder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any copy protection mechanism ; just avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD ; s !
while the setup needs to be made only once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , then the daily use to read a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk explains . this ( hopefully ) leads to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface that you often stum@@ ble across at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; obtain information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , all of which is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window &apos;s commands . on the step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request from CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet needs to be established . )
starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default . it should be noted that before the encoder was configured in the Settings dialog in the Settings dialog .
opens the file manager to select an already read file instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and en@@ code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as logs , tracks ) for program events ( like read out the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
open the main configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate , the differences are less important since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions but there are open license questions
+ High to very high audio quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is available .
MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto hi @-@ fi systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo hi @-@ fi systems . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . requires less than 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all tracks of a song . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and auto@@ oster@@ on equipment . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information entered manually or automatically fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title Par@@ ameters of &amp; audio @-@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; audio @-@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the assistant ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information , so that all the others can download this information rather than themselves into the calcul@@ ator . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces , etc . , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : that &apos;s the author ) bin not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway on a bum@@ ble@@ by a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; Audio Creator is set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia will be used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected . pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) can be added on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder pack@@ et must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used . this is also required for predefined enco@@ ders . more information about encoder is in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the writing and reading rights to it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . this could give a hint on what is wrong .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the CD ; this won &apos;t be possible !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you are using other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we &apos;ll use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course do .
please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section disc@@ usses the basic set @-@ up of &amp; audio @-@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read out a &amp; CD ; what to repeat for each reading &amp; CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them every time you read a &amp; CD ; if you have found the appropriate settings .
the device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
please select only for incomplete information so that you will be notified when data is missing to generate keywords ( tags ) .
the map CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD ; to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second selection box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found , immediately start reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory name or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to enter everything manually , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database previously . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first one . the mode is set on the following card .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we have not downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both function equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls use the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
number of simultaneously missing pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parall@@ el@@ es reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try yourself .
CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to disc@@ ard the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of wa@@ v files enco@@ ded at the same time : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine it can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just have the basic set up of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; quit . this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD is running on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built up as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b must be picked up .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a bit different from that for a &amp; CD ; with successfully fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn to enter the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this has not yet been done , the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , then browse the section Questions and answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully fet@@ ched from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the internet , you need the connection to the internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be entered in the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; field , unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. all words with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; audio creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . refer to the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the exit CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the CD Editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or out . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All Pi@@ ec@@ es button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once .
when clicking on the selection button read the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab Or@@ ders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see you when trying to work with a encoder you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus read out and coding in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . in case of low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is displayed .
for successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; install the k@@ de@@ multimedia package from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at persons compiled by source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various card post@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or modify something useful , may do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal .
strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others it has also some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , which other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; k@@ de ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or tex@@ tual events ) . k@@ mid automatically calcul@@ ates the process used .
session support . if you want to quit &amp; k@@ de ; when playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog whose help you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the toolbar , select the entry Cancel from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . ( in case of several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth .
when you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display to change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure acts on the space bar like pressing the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use texture events , others use song texture and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined , which a song is used , so that you do not need to manually set anything . so , if you activate the Auto text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ a@@ oke text is automatically selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select the menu entries or the song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the Collection Manager . this can be found in the collection menu under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the Collection Manager .
the temporary collection gets all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to Collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if the Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row after from the sub@@ menu Remove from the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the drop down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to continue a song , select the Next song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return the reverse a song , select the previous piece , the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow key to the left .
to delete a collection , open the Collection Manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type , and lets you hear a trumpet when you originally play a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conver@@ sions for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun . to do this , insert the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 ( ri@@ f@@ le shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term Drum patch of the patch , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as is their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
keywords are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel . take a look at the included key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply type in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a given channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword is used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events that attempt to change the patch on that channel will be ignored . in this case , patch x will always be used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates the ratio of Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der events to be multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch Ben@@ der Event with the value n , this is converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard that receives a pitch bench@@ marking event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards attempt to play two notes up to an oc@@ tave higher . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; play around .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a given channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob is no longer green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . the View menu can be selected in the Settings menu under the View channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
well , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file requires 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t feel like adding all files individually .
for this reason , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
check Activ@@ ate Automati@@ cally add to the collection before . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , only switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally Adding to the collection , and the new one ; file is added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the Auto Add to collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ str@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; MÃ ¡ laga . at the moment I &apos;m doing a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
you really get a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your home or an MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will record with friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and got money from anyone . I would like to emphasize that I only use it because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ash@@ i I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .

in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM radio device or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid with the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me .
&amp; S@@ ME ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on , as well as for playback of DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is only displayed when information is to be returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Tem@@ porary Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click an entry , its group and all its sub @-@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; S@@ ME ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select it from the View menu and select the next editing mode . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML content of that part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you have to select the playlist from the playlist menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; S@@ MB ; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Players / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ Players / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start @-@ up does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening a different source . however , this would be annoying in the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; / smil@@ ed ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; S@@ ME ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the Tool@@ bar of S@@ MB . here , the output of m@@ player is visible .
there is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; S@@ ME ; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , just like setting up the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; playing with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; S@@ MB to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ MB module must be specified as a service provider for the application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME ; is to be started in a console application and to browse for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ MB ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
to ensure that always a given back@@ end for a given mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if it has been determined ) , you have to do this by changing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c file . for example , phon@@ on should reflect all the og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ ME ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port is to be used . there , ports should be detected , of which one is selected . the encoding to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains dv@@ d in it .
since V@@ DR support from S@@ MEs can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of Video Devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . that &apos;s why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be working properly . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , therefore , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , KM@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of making this documentation this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ vert , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there hints how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is to be run as user root once the device is inserted . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom indicates the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is required for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; required .
latex ; : a professional writing application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be rever@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact over the ki@@ le ; website should be made .
if questions arise or when comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ; or if extensions are desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the possibility of using all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; -@@ Reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works using the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
for natural latex ; is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also use a lay ( close lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros . a less sophisticated but realistic explanation is that it originates from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while only a good overview of natural latex is given here , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to rule properly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex should be used : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed again with the \ \ end { document } command .
the Quick Intro@@ duction Wizard of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document . you can also set some settings related to the document .
document classes : this defines the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , foil &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of natural latex ; -@@ Docum@@ ents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex ; for the integration they must be selected only in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use in the creation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry now . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; if you want to see more complex areas of a green text on the screen , it is probably noticed by the modest appearance of the output file . however , it will save you time and time by high@@ lighting .
with automatic complete execution of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) from &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to lay down the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be ki@@ cked in menu settings ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ divided the lowest element ) :
when viewing the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click .
when creating one &apos;s own &amp; latex ; files , the back @-@ up search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file is created ( English e V ice I n@@ ailing file ) &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output ear@@ t of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing of DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back search , the elements of the DVI ; file are but@@ ton@@ ed with the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; the source text is j@@ umped . the default search is the exact opposite of it . once on a section in the &amp; latex ; -@@ source text , the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer is j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with other .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set project settings for project settings .
quick Construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on the &apos; unused &apos; , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick installation .
when looking at the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be show@@ c@@ ased . the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; commands for sub@@ division are :
the Other is available for inser@@ ting items such as tags , feet notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a designated term ( selection above a selection field ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last field of selection with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ens is used for determining the font sizes . you can set the font sizes for the main text , the joints etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two options are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from the ground up with the hand .
the bra@@ ces according to the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font sizes . if font sizes are not set at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex can be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the Men@@ Ã ¼ s construction or the button fast@@ ener .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if this is not the case , the logging should be followed automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report is created with the font size 12 and only a few signatures should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } enables then the change of let@@ tering within the environment .
the changes are only secured inside the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no nar@@ rowing ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain types of fonts , bold print , cur@@ sive print , sub@@ sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; latex is shown , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le follows .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be made . to do this , there should be a quote , a few passages in bold and itali@@ c pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor by means of editor view or C@@ trl E ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English e V ice I n@@ g ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file from the &amp; latex ; source code has been created , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; -@@ bin@@ dings . to do this , you just need to set up Modern under Settings ...
in order to perform the search , the mouse poin@@ ter needs to be positioned in a line of the source code and click on the preview search . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; the viewer then takes place .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ document of &amp; ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this you need to set &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ Please ; as text editor .
if an error occurs when using the Fast Construction of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the log file tells the error source in the source code . in the editor you can then use the Pre@@ ferences La@@ Te@@ X error and the first La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the incorrect line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; ki@@ cked ; jumps to the defective line .
once the corresponding button is cli@@ cked on the toolbar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set possibilities are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re @-@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . more information can be found in the section .
hands @-@ free users of natural latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file needs to be opened or a new file created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ...
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can choose your own template instead of the default ones .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files will be created . if a simple way is used to create a template , it should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ate ; as internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called over the Men@@ Ã ¼ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a valid description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ skip only \ \ par will be selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with the Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source texts . for example , the natural latex commands differ ; -@@ Comm@@ ands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can add additional jumps . these are a separate type of book@@ marks in the text . the Men@@ Ã ¼ Rou@@ ge edit ho@@ cks or the corresponding push @-@ keys allow the jump to the next or the last jump @-@ mark . thereby also this jump @-@ mark is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already excellent options have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important features for writing a &amp; latex ; source code are always supported &amp; ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection .
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines ( as in other text editors ) . this extended meaning conclu@@ des tables , and latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only wor@@ sen@@ ing thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the items are separated by two blank lines .
choose the word below the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a back rule ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to remove part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the C@@ trl + K key to remove the entire line . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands for faster possibility .
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for more orders under the Edit surroundings for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environment commands , the above overview can quickly be lost . this command closes the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure is not destroyed .
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; -@@ groups which are determined by clas@@ ps { ... } . under the Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment .
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the cur@@ ly clip of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , then jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups bra@@ ces you can quickly get lost . this command closes the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple quotation marks are used as a binary . for the purpose @-@ to @-@ use implementation is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple quotes . also for the end of the application the sign &quot; is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and provides two end @-@ to @-@ end grant signs for natural latex ; one .
this automatic insertion of the double suit characters can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or french ) and thus German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift + Enter key &amp; ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a Listen environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break .
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be ki@@ cked under Settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator may not belong to the next tab in the above line . although this tab@@ ul@@ ator may not belong to the next tab , add some space for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; to provide special commands ( mostly for natural latex ; ) . there are three different modes of operation . all of these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Ki@@ le ... Complete set .
start a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command ; automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last character of the input is removed and , as a result , the list will be removed . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command . alternatively , can be added by &amp; ki@@ le ; also jumps can be added , so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing the ho@@ ck brand N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste jump mark and the desired parameters can then be taken into place .
among Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; Con@@ vert settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands as well as books of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the enforcement mode call will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments .
when calling the complete setting of the complete environment or the keyboard short@@ cut Alt + Shift key , the command to start the environment is automatically enclosed and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input key .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a Listen environment , will even include a first \ \ item command .
among Settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ le ; Con@@ vert settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of termination mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately by dra@@ gging strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Box ... Ki@@ le can be set up . as an example of a crash list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , contains the L = \ La@@ Te@@ X entry .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word comprehen@@ sion mode is initiated by the menu Procedure Editor or C@@ trl + Alt whit@@ esp@@ ace , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large containers are not helpful for automatic digestion . however , it has been found that many more users in a document are written more than once . thus offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written boards .
this mode can be set up in the menu box ... Ki@@ le can be completely de@@ ported . here , the threshold value for the display of the complete compensation can also be specified .
the complete files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( dictionary ) or tex .
the Graphics dialog boxes the insertion of graphics as easy as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be considered .
PS files are not as popular as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is needed , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the tools are group@@ ed in the menu to compile comp@@ iling , create conversion and create view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by key single ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file can be viewed in a PS file and by using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Quick Construction command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project is about the Project New Project .... here@@ with the following information is requested for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ op@@ r project file .
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a large number of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ Live ; provided with a lot of documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; latex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; latex ; commands included and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ Live ; provided , finding the correct document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k which contains a database with all documents and graphical super@@ visions .
all documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or stro@@ kes . from &amp; ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or typing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .

&amp; Caribbean ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for emails . using the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , an arbitrary signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique .
for day signatures it is read the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signature , you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl + N file New . this will give you one lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S File Save or click Save the disk symbol .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross removing in the toolbar .
open the Quick command dialog . here you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right bottom and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to make signatures to your e @-@ mails you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
the older the pile insertion is , the lower its frame number . see the example below .
by clicking on a call stack entry in the shown list , the cursor is moved to the corresponding time number of the corresponding file in the main window .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as interface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it one piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired folder , then leave the current working folder attached . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time you get started .
as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is there now a great graphical interface for that .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current Working Fol@@ der . if not , then select the current Working Fol@@ der and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then let the current file be checked simply . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file cho@@ oser .
if you only want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed check selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; both for the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; required in the file selection .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be edited in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; already selected , then let the current file be selected simply . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file cho@@ oser .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug@@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; have , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone is using the wanted in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug@@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the Edit plugin menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage and add new plug@@ ins . we describe each and GUI element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug@@ ins without a location use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project involves several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to one another . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing members of the team : an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , if a file is saved , or a script that plays a file in CVS , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ;
events can be created , edited and deleted on the Event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the receiver list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
enter comments is simple . you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or insert the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the pointed star of the team member , is part of the project from the following possibilities : the corresponding area or sub @-@ project leaders should be given according to the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but whit@@ esp@@ ace around the cl@@ amps and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in .
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lower@@ case attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Groß / lower@@ case means that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , for tags that the closing tag is optional , this will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except the simple tags .
update start and end tags automatically : if enabled , the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding while typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . by means of the Standard Res@@ et button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise than files opened with file opening ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) , but this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is mess@@ ed up by modi@@ fying the modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout command line parameter .
the warning messages area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings from non @-@ demand warnings .
the location to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree showing the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be set in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ ture Settings section , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be automatically opened . empty nodes are empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the section for setting short@@ cuts ( a type of templates ) that un@@ folds when editing to more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins are K@@ part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , the most well @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be given :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read @-@ Only mode &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ Read @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if the entered information is correct , then select the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a debu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations about plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inserts .
the use of the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin selection box , the specific settings can be changed .
if a Deb@@ ug@@ ger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all the holding points , with time numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
depending on the supported features of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the debu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a debu@@ gger , so normally it does not have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution continues . if it started before a debu@@ gging request was started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a Deb@@ ug@@ ger request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the debu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , and if possible , it will be corrected in functions and include .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to skip the statement and proceed as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us to your needs and how you can help &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to provide support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; its simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s . tag folders contain two file types , file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool tracks are handy , symbolic @-@ oriented lines of image buttons ( above the editing pane ) , the text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for conversion details .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the tag . file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ n@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow for quick inser@@ ting tags into a document without any risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as a mere element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
specifies the source code used to fill in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a section name and a method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container day group@@ ed together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag that is to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; , especially in elements like &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
below is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
below is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; optionally &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for manipul@@ ating D@@ TD Edi@@ te D@@ TD . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set by setting actions ... created . clicking New action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . you can insert a text in the detail@@ led settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . in this way , the script tries to find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; process . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the input % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the standard error output . it can be specified which is to be done with the output written to the standard output , by setting the output selection box :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New action button at the bottom of the window opens the Edit mode .
fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable &quot; Edit Tag &quot; dialog when available so that an input can be entered while using the action .
Ig@@ t ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels as default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the day start , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green it is usually perceived as loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled by clicking on this symbol ; start@@ gt ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with Settings Select actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selection of desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so there are any , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the toolbar setting dialog on Settings Tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to preview the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by hal@@ ving all the symbols to ensure everything is working .
save to the right folder . after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder but your toolbar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder . please adjust its file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ n@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( s ) when a file is opened from the appropriate type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we will treat here .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example file documentation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Tag 1 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own contents . there is no known boundary for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the Table of Cont@@ ents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folders will be shown ! ) .
spaces don &apos;t affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; resource files replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that serves to create context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation should be displayed for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would appear directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file link lines .
a simple list of context elements separated by comm@@ a ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your doc@@ r@@ c ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to there .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used for the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ community . you will not be rich , but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an email @-@ send menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool @-@ like tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us users can download them . the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication . in order to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of the resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and by clicking OK the upload must be started .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool tracks , and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examine &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; however , creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is a simpler way to automatically convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Load and Con@@ vert menu of D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description that you want to use . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P file is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folders .
! Doc@@ type Defin@@ tion Line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; therefore , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely to them without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system .
local items represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ mut@@ sters to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the tabs with info and the toolbar . please click in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all the tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zer , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents , such as basic processing steps ( Cut / Copy / Pa@@ ste ) , edit the tags , mouse @-@ cursor , or open the file , if the string under the mouse cursor is a file .
at the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard for which a set of tool bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs .
the use of toolbar buttons is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , such as &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . now you can insert the data for this just added day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog with different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate through the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open it and ro@@ am . in the presentation with tabs , for files , projects , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation construction views are available .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions like add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button , further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send it by email .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands appears in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it man@@ ure can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and any changes to the D@@ TD are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar by email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; send the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a toolbar in an email , you can secure and load it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other tool !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us files on your system . therefore , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H before your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while attempting to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; an independent , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up Language editor ? well , this would make it the most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; following , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework , it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , automation is possible almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detail documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ ach@@ help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry will be removed .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write , which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost , to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches the block selection to or from . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift + button .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script releases error messages !
searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debu@@ gger .
turn on and turn the bug report at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . then the selected files will be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows you to copy , for example , graphic files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of tool bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be set by setting actions ... can be added . tool bars are stored by tool bar tool bar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the disk . if you have not saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do so .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ team , so that the toolbar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables upload of tool tracks to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; makes sense if the entities are to be refres@@ hed from &amp; D@@ TD ; if it is global and if there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insert of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by a tool bar is denied if this tag in this place contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed among the menu items listed above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on the file type ; version .
choose the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
check the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries the switching can sometimes need time or cause uneven graphics . recommended is the card card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . with the selection of an entry the corresponding sub@@ window is activated .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
sets the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar , or add which ones you can add and change the sequences .
this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project , e.g. after filling out the project name . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F@@ 7 project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , the file is filled out automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) .
here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ pix@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set rather than the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
leave if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to Gut@@ enberg .
this displays a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window profiles or by Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the desired debu@@ gger . currently , only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
upload Pro@@ files ( see in ) , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by adding a separate tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can activate event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file .
by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior right now .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project icon project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button is bl@@ ended to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk save option is not available .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function .
the transfer protocol for upload . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be easily read , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool tracks . it can give many views in a project , i.e. through simple exchange of view various files and tool tracks can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible from the Tool@@ bar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own way of working .
as already mentioned above , tool bars are stack@@ able in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; best viewed through the toolbar menu . usage and addition differ . adding tool tracks is treated at the bottom of the section Adding work@@ stations .
the toolbar and the icons can be set using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool bar ) , in which new action can be created , a new toolbar can be created , other actions such as tool bar can be removed , tool bar can be renamed , or tool@@ bars can be executed where actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and action will be displayed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool bar and the actions on them can set up tool bars in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings ...
templates are essentially documentary skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the restrictions you provide for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. pictures with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information on the template tree is available in .
documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template , but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire web sites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate Save ....
once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save Sel@@ ection as Local / Project Tem@@ plate . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dropped to the tree view templates .
binary templates are simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project file tree view , you can click a folder on the right and select Site Tem@@ plate , enter a name for the template and secure it . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre @-@ emp@@ t he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically associate with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / DLL and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to set the behavior of a folder , click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led when el@@ ter@@ able attributes are inherited .
if a root folder were set in such a way , it would de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or illustrated text for templates in this folder . this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to add a whole presentation to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers in a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
additionally , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one location to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor which can be reached via the View menu . first mode sub@@ stitutes the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and second spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; -@@ Source text . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . by pressing F@@ 9 this mode is active , this mode is active , the button of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another , keeping the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL ; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ators and a large breakdown for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the tools document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is created .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows to change the contents , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the contents column .
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . in rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or remote key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way using the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag .
some tool bars like the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . you will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used tool tracks .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other programs for style sheets , searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to successfully compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; still need the lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available for a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed stops can be placed in a specific file and line number and activated later .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g returns the complete path from a file name without a path . file names in the same folder as the top@@ most loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style sheet file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or total correspondence is checked with a pres@@ et named my@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches any of the my@@ ME that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; is extended according to the rules specified in the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be solved for the corresponding UR@@ I and time number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are checked again shortly after starting each iter@@ ation .

there are many graphic tools to compare . so why so &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes while at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function changed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time shows the result to be expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you to merge and merge the entire folder . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder Mer@@ ge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and den@@ otes the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often have to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more anno@@ y@@ ance if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can facilitate typing by simply writing the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example :
k@@ not 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder 2 folder folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder
the Open dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog tells your selection and displays it next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
by pressing the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for goal and can be edited . however , it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / mer@@ ging .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . in the opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would only need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can remove nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line in the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , you can see at the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that is good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line is displayed on the dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording Volume : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ographical &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , every difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes , no more line is left in the batch by automatic mer@@ ging or by editing manually . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet again choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a tag that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the Text &amp; lt ; Con@@ fusion Conf@@ lic@@ ts ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy this text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if you choose to ignore the numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page , page , beginning , end , C@@ trl start and C@@ trl end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all the windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the summary and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Image Up@@ ward / C@@ trl @-@ Image A@@ way ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ Pa@@ ste ) . if this option is enabled , you will automatically copy whatever you mark , automatically copy to the clip@@ board and skip the manual copy . however , be careful with this option , because you might inad@@ vert@@ ently over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems do not use back@@ sp@@ line + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 preserves the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should not use them with binary files .
the options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore it to the next start . ( set up Settings &gt; &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be sc@@ aled . on these systems , the Button Pre@@ ferences automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab key is pressed . otherwise , a tab character is inserted .
when you press Enter or Return , the previous line will be automatically applied to the next line .
when this option is checked , each option is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . you do not need to copy manually into the clip@@ board .
you can select which line type you prefer for saving . the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system .
when comparing files tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others only save a new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , the car returns will be visible , but this option may be disabled . during mer@@ ging , this option has to be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
by default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow to very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapters on scanning of folders and performing a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and an older version already exists , then the original version of the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g will be app@@ ended . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further f@@ use .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not apply to the current program . you need to quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the encoding fields for the encoding , a quick reference appears , which is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . )
customize the file coding for source files . this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually configurable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
when you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress revision of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded ke@@ yst@@ one column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will appear next to the normal yet another over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply remove the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu , even if you compare only two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last file used will be retained . )
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function , e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or for correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command has been specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command .
the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it himself . however , the good news is that in most cases , sed or per@@ l are sufficient .
use this command line to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an erg@@ ul@@ ary expression that fits all characters in a line . the \ \ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first clip pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use a few keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all of them follow the same sample $ keyword created text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line ab@@ norm@@ alization is required . the \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Author \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Date \ \ ) is needed because $ is a special character and would mean the end of the line .
while you experim@@ enting with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line compar@@ isons . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi @-@ cleared .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs a few details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the line interval is seen .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hide differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can easily compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the suggestion before starting ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and displays simul@@ ated changes without really carrying out them ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the file dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder has been specified , use the folder 3 as the destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed .
if the scanning of the folder is completed , shows &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is normally folded up . you can un@@ fold a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions , all sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or un@@ fold all the folders .
double @-@ clicking on a file will start the comparison of the file and a comparison window will appear .
the name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically chosen . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind .
as shown in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are regarded as identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green then yellow and later when it is old , red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the syn@@ cing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; co@@ de@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option to select Save File instead of merge ( uncertain ) is enabled then an error message appears error : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not fixed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
when mer@@ ging , a file is executed after another . it indicates Finish when mer@@ ging successfully , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a last check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflicts column will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected item ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then it is used as a target in the Three @-@ folder Mer@@ ge mode , B is selected as the target , and A and / or B are used as a target when synchron@@ izing A and / or B .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all the entries that should be in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) to merge only the current entry : select Run the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if illegal merge actions still exist due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all the entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , S@@ aves and Cancel options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , choose to restart / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work continues with the next entry .
if you breach an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been combined individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not be combined again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the el@@ em@@ ental tree . multiple patterns can be entered . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ c@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ c@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ ym@@ atic generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a preceding dot design@@ ates a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is switched on in default .
when the option is turned off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
for links to folders : when the option is turned off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recur@@ sively . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
perform a complete analysis of each file and display the statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders via a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this advantage will cost you a certain degree of security .
similar to Trust the Change Date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date . please use caution . this option is turned off in default .
activ@@ ates the Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical . also , the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off by default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered un@@ safe , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is shut down in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another one , then the original version is renamed and gets the .@@ orig@@ . if an old backup file exists with the .@@ c@@ g extension , it will be deleted without additional backup . this also applies to normal mer@@ ging of individual files , not only the compilation of entire folders . this option is switched on in default .
normally the folder view is visible in the merge of single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can disable the Option Directory &amp; Text window and switch to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder . to do so , use the current file merge from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to first and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it can &apos;t be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is assumed as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change @-@ by date . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is possible only for local files . )
the main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . if it is used as a K@@ Part , it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the input file needs a patch file in unified format . then the file names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file .
in kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view into - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
if &amp; ch@@ diffusion is executed as part , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff@@ 3 program from the diff tool collection .
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ de@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines disappear next to each other , this is the right attribute but this is more often the case .
the editor re@@ members each difference in the files where it begins and where it finishes . this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly , No sr@@ c is left ; the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors for high@@ lighting differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .

cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Removal ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) adds the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all files do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed when clicking the button .
by default , this option is disabled . differences in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the des@@ kt@@ ops , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on , the context menu has just the two entries P@@ ager ... and ends . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in addition , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maximize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .

if this check box is selected , Windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
if this field is checked , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is checked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , and eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this box is checked , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is checked , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program windows . icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is recommended for very fast systems .
here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be specified : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal row and vertical right in a vertical row , which is very well suited for displaying on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . in addition , it runs out of the control bar .

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen motion . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen as if you would like to read a lou@@ pe for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for various users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for use by &amp; k@@ mag ; .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded with new features . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you start &amp; drop ; a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged section of the screen . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fying window .. The image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting increases &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse cursor is like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the magni@@ fied window , select the mouse cursor position . please note that &amp; k@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift + Shift key or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection box .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it into other applications later ) , turn the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update will cause the CPU time to switch to 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document re@@ charge in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use an area of screen to zoom in as if you use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click once the mouse cursor is har@@ ming for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury syndrome ) and that any mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor is har@@ ming for a while at the same location . it is intended to help people suffering from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and that any mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that occurs when you click with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movement and takes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move is activated , the m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool gives a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es move is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button , wait before pressing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse takes place .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking the mouse shift . if this feature is activated , a slow move to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but the first time is started , but they can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; go to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a slide control sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently available only under &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already cli@@ cked the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last press of App@@ ly .
the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later add the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds .
first , you should make yourself aware of what places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again .
when your mouse is rolling you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be stopped by letting the mouse button down .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and place the cursor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I do not manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to mark text , copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it again or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use it as follows : hold a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will each time , if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the move time starts when moving smart . later , you can use the intelligent shift even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window ; this should already be the case on most system .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and those suffering from the pressing of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a drag procedure starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping using the mouse can also be performed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth ; is a program that allows mu@@ te user to let their computer speak for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; can let silent users speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command which will be used later for the voice output of text . see the description of the setup dialog for more details .
on the second page , you can choose the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) you specify the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
if you set mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the default memory . you can select sets which are to be spoken again .
with menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two learning flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ Incre@@ ase page as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the text output input field , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the box below the input field , specify the character encoding using the text to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways of passing the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course the command for voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your voice generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . if this is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standardized interface for voice output and that is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text pass@@ book menu or in the bar for text passage books .
the selected text passage is inserted directly into the input field with the selection of In the input field . the selected text passage is first entered in the input field .
the second selection box C@@ lose the editing window for text pass@@ book lets you determine whether the text output book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text preview book , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text output book is not saved . select Before saving , and k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passage directory should be saved .
the Wor@@ ter@@ Incre@@ ase page contains a list of dictionary entries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and the language for the dictionary .
select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Docum@@ entation . the frequency of the single words is simply compared by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly added words automatically add to the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary through time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of text or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books either using the selection in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text @-@ section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk buffer .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected parts of the disk storage .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences from the default location .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar can be placed via the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
when this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text output books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is located above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the voice output command properly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the voice output command in the language edition . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thesizer for further details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and Malay@@ al@@ am are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival free of charge and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival . the voice output command is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written voice generator . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ ett . the voice output is then possible with one of the following three command examples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ jah and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax often swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / jihadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as a default input must be enabled .
the speech output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ wide voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting the language generator only takes place in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use desktop as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but that depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who can &apos;t speak can om@@ it text by the calcul@@ ator . it stores a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can spend time and time again .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include a voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( either enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text about the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
pre @-@ reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ates ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications .
speech output is provided using the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
allows the generation of language editions to the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ utility .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech mark@@ up met@@ a ( SM@@ ML ) .
the &amp; k@@ de voice output service ; an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d over kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or module ; for reading texts on a website or parts thereof .
a text editor module with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the k@@ de @-@ command mailing list . subscribe to the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ accessibility . the developers also find you in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de @-@ accessibility ) .
before you can use it , you need to install and correctly set the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher .
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , or as long as no spokes@@ persons are set up , the card will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the map Gener@@ ally will be displayed .
most T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should set at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
several speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
when you click on the Spe@@ aker &apos;s Leader in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the Post@@ card Hol@@ der will be displayed . it will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl voice to choose from .
click here to see the new speaker on the Post@@ card Spe@@ aker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the map Gener@@ ally and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled to make the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders .
if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language drop@@ out system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the Gener@@ ally tab to open this card . here you can set some general options .
select this check box to activate the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed , and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; on , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear automatically in the Control bar &apos;s system area when reading it , it disappears as soon as the preview is completed .
with the buttons in this row you can start , stop , pause and record text orders .
with the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the Order Card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to read and select Tools Text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ front lines and other invisible brands are also read out .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the text displayed . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then select the text to read , and select Tools Text in the Main Menu . then the speech output should begin .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is &amp; k@@ de news system , noti@@ fying you of events that you have specified . you can also read &amp; drop the text of this news .
in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the &amp; k@@ de I@@ RC program , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up that you are notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as pres@@ upp@@ os@@ ed in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . it is useful for the improvement of pron@@ unciation to replace wrong@@ ly spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice synthesis and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . if the output of Screen readers is read @-@ out , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after issue of warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a web page , you can arrive at &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order you create from the map sheet is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular ur@@ gency .
all four job types are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this output is stopped and terminated .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there can still be more types of filters .
string replacement parts replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; provided with predefined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . included in the scope of delivery ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example on the card card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules to apply for a speech output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text assignment , message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all the activated filters set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are de@@ activated from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
to set up string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it must differ only from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Er@@ rors . the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ gi@@ es@@ Filter apply if all the input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all the texts .
by comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . thus , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it in the di@@ alogs Add or Edit as help to put together these expressions .
XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the auxiliary program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PAT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , or a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts from k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text is sent to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that sets the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the properties of the speaker you want . when the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to best meet the required requirements . click on the button on the right to display the speaker selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your speech preferences or to delete all settings .
the speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ gi@@ es@@ Filter apply if apply . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the voice syn@@ thesizer , so that you can use this syn@@ thesizer .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API from &amp; k@@ de ; see the full documentation for both APIs on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications request voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text to read and an option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Form@@ ing filter , but when using the module for the festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone for S@@ able to work at all . you must also do that by yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ?
first , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string replacement filter .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the corresponding documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that own your own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package dec@@ lines with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it . you can also find the source code from k@@ de@@ lava under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
it contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages , can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the webpage of kt@@ ts ; for information not yet contained in this manual .
the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses a customizable module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; t@@ t@@ t to use another syn@@ thesizer , please contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
to compile , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for dec@@ lines or download the tar@@ ball that has been created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use it , first check whether speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ as @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g program should be developed in such a way that the implementation of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the sp@@ it @-@ conf script is no longer required .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . for example , if you have set up a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you see in .
when you click on Add Spe@@ aker on the map , and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the map Spe@@ aker setup will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , just enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . for voices known as dict@@ ations , this setting is automatically made . in general , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select a few controls and display them grey , the chosen voice doesn &apos;t leave these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be loaded on account of their size . when you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with bigger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click App@@ ly ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window will be displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed in advance or return in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order is made up of several sets ) .
by clicking on the OK button , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed here . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled and kt@@ ts ; either compiled or t@@ apped without support for the appropriate audio module ; it cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equals about half and 200@@ W ; % roughly the double normal speaking speed . to enable these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of the AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out for yourself which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
on this tab you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops them . once the Screen readers output has been read , the retained jobs are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor gets too hot . a warning will stop the output of messages and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks out messages . if you read &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can arrive at &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , add the audio output to the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played prior to the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the map al@@ erts appear .
tick this check box to enable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played will be read by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this field to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the features of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the list of speakers as the top entry .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can set the noti@@ fications to be notified as follows :
use the Save button to save the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Load button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty schedule , click Del@@ ete .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard includes brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of e.g. abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently , SS@@ ML supports only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ gr ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can start &amp; kt@@ ts ; faster with reading , since only the first sentence has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . thus , you can also forward or pause orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other set limit recognition filters , but beginners will not be advised .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read . check the selection of speakers , change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , you have to set more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with reading , because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can pause or break text orders on the map sheet , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional characters and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard layout recognition filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit recognition filter , you can insert it again by rel@@ o@@ ading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the card selection menu you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application .
use of the standard speaker ( the top@@ most one on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaking abilities are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the features of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , then select this speaker .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select here the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in the issue of output , it is always treated as the primary feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is present when you know that a particular application sends text in another language other than that set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the speaker area , which most closely corresponds to the following , click on the default spokes@@ man and then use the speaker closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr runs immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and trac@@ ts ; it has been terminated . G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command gst @-@ registers @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not resolved , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is possibly installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears that says : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr shows this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ As a guide , you can use the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the URL you found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and located via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ Modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card for speaking devices a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML Converter filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I do not manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ats ; read the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that Festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I added my own string replacement filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more rows forwards or backwards . on the trac@@ er orders will be displayed , the order will consist only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered out . instead use a filter for syntax identi@@ fiers instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the G@@ Stre@@ amer modules are registered by running G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts ; running the command @-@ register file . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ edi@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . furthermore , if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can then install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included .
have you downloaded and t@@ t@@ t ; as tar@@ ball ( tar@@ ball @-@ packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball to a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have runtime dependen@@ cy of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option column indicates the configure parameter which causes the creation of the creation .

before you use your syn@@ thesizer , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , its source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . help you find the instructions provided with the Festival . if you would like to read web pages , you must install the ( male ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / right / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a ky@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) coding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for Festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output from it . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete speech output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates voice from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German text di@@ phones . more information can be found here .
in this procedure , additional Wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis notes . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Vo@@ ices . required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playing the bug fixes is not necessary , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m .

on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just paste the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 won &apos;t work with I@@ MS German Festival .
this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; get and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download Festival @-@ Czech from
un@@ zip the program with tar into a matching folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your PAT@@ H .

start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map speaker you click Add . if the Ep@@ ic programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the map speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter an epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h in the input fields to get more information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can set neither pitch , volume nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer located in a command line , can be controlled from the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) rather than sending the output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to manage network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed at &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of the network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing and installing Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which best fits the distribution and the release state . by selecting the setting not @-@ again @-@ questions , the definition can be hit permanently . at the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the button system management mode at the right lower end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
the settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface ... can be edited in the Device dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to open dialog with further options .
with the automatic mode , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be executed at the same time with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setup is required . in the selection list either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server , according to the system , can be selected .
with the option Man@@ ually you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask entry field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on your needs . switch @-@ on of an out@@ dated network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs . switching off an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
sets the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name into an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the name resolution makes it easy to manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry , or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ds or Her@@ on buttons .
by clicking on the button Add ... from the group Calcul@@ ator for name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
select one entry from the group Calcul@@ ator for name resolution and then click the Edit button .... You will see the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name specifies the name @-@ to @-@ IP address reference for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for boot when there are no DNS servers available .
normally the list contains some known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ak@@ apo ; and some specific IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still under test will replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the known machine has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Con@@ ver@@ ted Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
you can perform one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command needs to be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sourc@@ e@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case the installation of Q@@ t and Q@@ t is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second chapter all of the configuration files are discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been widely distributed . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future . therefore , this description is currently focusing on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point for a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used .
when setting up your own small network , the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , you can access the Internet for such machines by adjusting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding .
the power address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circuit .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another state than expected can therefore occur .

before a tape can be used , it must be mounted by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; returns the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the band . recognize &amp; dat ; the pre@@ tension on the tape do not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
know &amp; k@@ dat ; the advance credits , it searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band .
before ej@@ ecting the belt , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; indicates by a change of the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat ; it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not match format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; . if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; k@@ dat ; however , floppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives are not .
after entering the band name and capacity , continue &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the belt are lost thereby ! after completion of the format@@ ting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use .
before you start the backup process , you must select the files to be secured , which can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save In the Save ...
once the backup is started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the backup settings .
if you have confirmed the settings , the Backup dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Check ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for review . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the Working Fol@@ der for review .
if you have confirmed the checking settings , the dialog will appear Vali@@ date . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the throughput of the data and the time remaining .
before re@@ connecting , the files that are to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rec@@ over from the menu ....
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog appears to restore . in this dialog you can check your selection once again and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the restore settings , the dialog will appear Rest@@ ore . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the throughput of the data and the time remaining .
sometimes it is necessary to re @-@ create the tape @-@ index file by means of the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files . each file is viewed by tar independently from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are saved .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
this del@@ etes the snapshot file from tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings through the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the instruction mt load is loaded to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the throw at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the integration of &amp; dat , the band will be ej@@ ected automatically . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; dat ; to change the hardware @-@ driven block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must inform &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should contain only one memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the rest of the files on the tape are just tar archives , which can be handled directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work unless they are incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for System Lo@@ gs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various log files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows for quick access , for example , on information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the log files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various log files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence , try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log provides functions that easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup tried &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - to open . if you don &apos;t see it , and it opens a small message window , you have not started with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or entered strings . enter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter .
you can also select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the process column , and in the filter bar , select the name of a process , and then indicate the name of a process in the filter bar ; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as minutes lines of the Level Note . the colored display of log lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the Process column . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case use the filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the To Show new lines in the Main Window &apos;s context menu to display all new notes in addition .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you can find more current information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; can also be found in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops to the standard for control of program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it .
I will not go down here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not on / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD @-@ In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to run while up@@ loading the system or switching to another run level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d on the one hand if you need it . most systems own this file , even if there is not much use for it . you may also put a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something on boot , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning area you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have confused something , then you come to repair it by re@@ starting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be inv@@ oked with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server run level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; furthermore , I could also have a user Run@@ level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you can learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run levels to launch it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between levels or modify the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you move them to a new level . in order to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you explicitly need to select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed previously in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ bet number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the entries before attempting to add the system service again .
note : at present , there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working ranges ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it to the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl + X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl + V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ ing , and now the machine is constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be OK ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; to run under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are launched in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check if all the configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not available or false .
the significance of the &amp; Linux ; runtime varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ level so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation from &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu .
the main window consists of two tabs , the user group and the user groups list . to edit , select the user or group you want with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the user and group properties dialog .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have wild@@ card limitations ( quot@@ a ) enabled for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD implem@@ entations .
the password management card will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD implem@@ entations .
this card only appears if there is space limitation ( quot@@ a ) enabled and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable by the quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group file system on the file system ) . parameters can be changed here for each user , whereby the space limitations are in KB in each case :
these parameters can be individually set for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation
the tabs groups provide information about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , you will find in the field Prim@@ um Group . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large box .
the Properties dialog box contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user on the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
