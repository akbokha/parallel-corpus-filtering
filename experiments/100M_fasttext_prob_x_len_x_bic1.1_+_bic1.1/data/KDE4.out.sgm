<seg id="1">Translate the module website in the & konqueror; menu under Extras page. select the source and target language of the translation from the list on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated as the whole URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">In the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated on the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert texts that can be translated directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them more readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in features you can find in the manual to & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; choose Setting extensions... Open the box tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard setting modules from the kde; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed, you may need more modules on your system.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, which contains & konqueror, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; click on Tools Cancel. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module approach filter (also called the folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror menu bar under Extras Angle Filters. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, choose Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default, the display starts with the root tip of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views in order to view the contents of your local filesystem.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView; consists in presenting nested hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be detected even then easily if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap presentation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color combination and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over View color mode can display either depth for easy detection of the nesting depth or the mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify if it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and hence, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of Treemap in & FSView, it is not always observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of the entries, and these boxes need space that is then no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How to divide the area of an entry for subordinate entries, the implementation is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive divisions.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimally displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View for area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the use of KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Picture Gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras picture gallery... or with Ctrl + I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery module, a dialog opens that allows you to set the look of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a script to set the number of thumbnails on each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the check box File name of the image you specify whether the file names are displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">To view the file size of the image, specify whether the file size is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you can specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder dialog, specify where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the file selection Save in HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set up with a slider or a turn field, up to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the Commentary text box, you can use a comment file for caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original images.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings provides easy access to general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play click on the navigation pane of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifiers add a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system detection for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses access with this browser, change the browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that reject access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser identifier to connect to the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages which do not comply with the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - Elements and attributes are correctly displayed with the identification of this obsolete browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digi.More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system is digitized; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digikam; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use this to view, comment, rate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or the lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digikam; try to report problems or suggestions as easily as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu contains an entry problems or requests.... This opens a dialog with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser opens a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list is spoken English, you should be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digitization; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about & digikam; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to get involved is logging in the developer mailing list. instructions for logging in to the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you first start, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can enter a local, remote or removable folder here. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data logger is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digikam; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a collection of images on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images as a base folder. & digikam; considers every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed. while browsing the folder you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digikam; recursively recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is in hidden folder. you can do this by inserting one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and using it on the folder icon. more details can be found in the albums section.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my albums and my keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, you can work with it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported tube cameras in the Help menu support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to you to connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly in & digi.More than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and each card reader that is supported by your operating system is digitized; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera then appears as a disk device. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digikam; uses the program gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras, which is a constantly increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and are slow transfer via the serial port, this connection is now out of date. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">With libexif support, libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the thumbnails reliably. if the Exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnail images may not be seen or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to do & digitization is how easy it is to expand its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovmg and Gwenview to develop. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in almost any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digitized; by writing a small module to supplement a function when the changes in & digikam; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures work everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenthic, over the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that one image cannot be stored in keywords, time list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to select the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, the filter on the filename only works if this ind the symbol view is also shown. which fields are displayed, you can configure in the dialog box settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides a organized view on your photo albums. all photos that are edited by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums may be sorted by the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created. the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it down. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and select Edit Properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos if you want to add or delete collections from the collection. if you want to add or delete collections, you can do so in the collections settings.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, New Year's buttons: these put the date on the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. this will first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file in this folder will instead be used.</seg>
<seg id="92">If you first have an album in & digikam; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview, select it. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the entry of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom left of the main window. album collections have a different effect. they can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. when you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview window, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using Extras View all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image will be shown below the appropriate preview. which information is, you can edit settings, change it. select the albums page and adjust the thumbnail area to your preferences.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer at a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the tags of a photo. the screenshot above in the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all about & digikam; works. albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can choose any features that have been edited, using the contextual menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar. you can choose between viewing pictures, slideshow or editing of images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the picture editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image Edit... or selecting the right mouse button and selecting Edit... in the Edit menu. image editing is a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the submenu of Open. for this, and how to customize these to your needs, if your program is not listed you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing, other image editing programs may cause problems with the image containing in the picture. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the modified image. this way, this information is lost from the EXIF data and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digikam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click with the right mouse button on the preview and select turning. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. keep in mind that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digikam, it will be moved to the garbage bin by & kde; postponed. F8 Image Delete or Del If you prefer to really delete it, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Data List; organize your photos on the basis of data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month are shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view, so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed to you.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos tagged with this keyword will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword listequot; so you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are saved in a database for quick access and assigned cue in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs as soon as & digikam; the images are noticed.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you click a new keyword after you click on an existing keyword, this will become the subkeyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by drag it to the desired position in the tree and discard it. then appears a menu that gives you the possibility to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be only once in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, click the image with the right mouse button and select Add as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">In order to be able to use it with keywords, you first need to provide your photos with keyword. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you wish to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; Drag and drop there. alternatively, you can click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo is displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords associated with it. in this way, you can receive a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have completed a photo with keyword, this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you click with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu Remove. the menu shows you only the keywords associated with the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view displays a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection box can be moved over this histogram. in order to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame, which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will then appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all the elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next he search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search is found. if you click here, the filter will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again. if the search has found nothing, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the rider in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box as described above. you can save this search here but as a live search that always filters what you have entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search is performed. the Save As text field will be used to assign a name to My search list. if you want to change your selection after the search, you only need to select the corresponding entry from the My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit the search, the form will appear to enter the search again with the search information you previously entered. if you select as an advanced search, the dialog for Advanced Search will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for the search. see the Advanced search tool for more information.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete from the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced search provides an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digikam; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added line by line, separated by operators. each option can be associated with others via logical operations All..., A..., No... or At least... you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a swellerts the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere along the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then this will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand colour sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digikam; find the matching pics. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to pull a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. this assumes, of course, that your images contain geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a luminous table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl + L The light table added from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window will be opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you preview the preview from the toolbar and perform the Zoo or move operations on one of the images, then these are also performed on the other image. you can thus compare the same range of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited for quickly sorting out of a series of images. if you use pairing from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the fields for comparing. use the left mouse button at any preview image to see it in the right pane. this simplifies the work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal fire actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the light table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to swivel the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; hold down. in the preview mode, both pictures will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom function works just like in other views. just use the zoom-knob under the pictures or Ctrl; scroll wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both pictures when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage. each of the photos, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient manner.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, protect, protect and reuse photos. we focus on the procedures for digital photographers which digitize; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, archiving, optimizing, waiting and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management records, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confectioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I dare to say if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need to find a certain photo longer without inventory management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use digikam;. the approach to save metadata both in a database and in the image files ensures very fast search and secure archiving for you to freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you need to decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Maybe you will be happy with this structure. holiday images can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use sub-folders like & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is a folder for images that you can print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of pictures to different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to save the metadata option in & edited the metadata on the settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? that's why & digikam; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, annotations and a rating to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos in further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's talk with keywords, keywords, how you frequently refer to other programs or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. reorganizing the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very crude representation, since each block of metadata exists in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then you begin to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you that this is the landing site of the Allied & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing is. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you might even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others viewing your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate interest. if you want to show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help him over the motif that you have moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to act with a labeling for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digitization; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. if you export your pictures in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your wishes into the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it Earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of exploiting geolocation are already innumerable and will be deepened in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips using images with geographic information. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps Viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and writer): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples for this can be titles such as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note on the author field, this must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publishers (synonym for vendors): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the photographer is a stock photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they offer no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little bit more than basic knowledge in working with calculators can delete or change the metadata embedded in the picture. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digikam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, power surges, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread aberration</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery firm, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To fight the problem with CDs / DVDs, they have to be cautious and you can't believe them for more than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control humming mechanism to protect. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there's a reasonably priced program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs on Windows and Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications read out corrupted disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disk can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that has been said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the media with a description, date & author, and then store on a clean, dark dry and in front of animals sheltered place. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep track of their statistics for themselves. their production warranties include a new disk, but not data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanism of hard drives: disk Study</seg>
<seg id="187">In short: discos are the longest in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate increases dramatically with lower temperature tures. electronic parts of the controller are the most common error reason, SMART can not detect these errors. this is especially read errors and publishing counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">During most electric devices electric shocks don't matter much, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware design, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs some of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in bar. remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for overvoltage protection, be sure to comply with the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since overvoltage can be used for each cable to your computer, you should ensure that also all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems since it can also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the modem's protection.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in an uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. some models allow you to keep your data stored and run in order. if you purchase a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of power failure with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 40. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google Shared Storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore suitable only as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures at full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should be checked in reality first.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are desastersafe.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs at least ensure data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you one day open a photo and this is to your surprise. no one ever seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can handle plate defects on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a GPL license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrfs file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss for the notebook and 46% in the workplace systems. in case of notebooks, the proportion of thefts amounts to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to data loss than proprietary systems: false, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the widened file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: false, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: false, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Digital cameras sensors are 1-2 stops of fundamental physical limitations. it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards the 10 megapixel resolution sensors. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolution you need a full-size sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make no one responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are affected by a data loss each year. so secure your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, sharing disks or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make every day your fuses on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you have luck when the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. don't forget aviation disaster: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, to the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above, there is a common reason for a loss of data despite fuse of panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original state at any time that such a backup has been made. this backup comes with an unversioning system next with the exception that is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled ftp sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or any other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach leaves you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you will get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC information, associated XMP files, original keeping, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years, that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be taken into account:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature you have to look at everything that is said today with care and review it while time goes by. unfortunately, there is no other way to have a certain vigilance. all the 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by means of the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory, and security technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert it to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the printer expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and want to enlarge the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was recognized by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdb, the new record is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # operates with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment for heterogeneous platforms. the drawback is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files. a problem is, however, that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a royalty-free and open source format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers already provides DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Extend Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data in a file itself. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive a copy of your image, mostly in the raw format. XMP adapts to it as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it may cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera medium, you can use it as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a more sophisticated editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again with & digikam; edit, then you should add the metadata again, which may have been cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the copyrighted images for copyright with a digital watermark. only export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digities.In the Adding a photo to an album, you will find a description how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabases.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished -indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata meta shows the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the metadata side bar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the download button and then downloading All. this loads all photos from their camera to a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded safely into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can only select the desired one with the default selection methods by & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button Selected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New Download is available. these images have not been digitized until now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you use the All downloads or download Selected, a dialog with which you can select the target album is displayed in which the photos are filed. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Album section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digikam; load the photos from the camera into the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by using the Delete button. if you only want to delete some, you must select them first and then use Delete Selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera. the photos will not be moved to the garbage bin by & kde; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in & kde; if you want to delete the camera file completely, you should do so via the camera menu, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are normally used again after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names, if you upload photos from different recording series to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the filename.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based subalbums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two are the data about the author in the standard auto identity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries will be copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you wish to use a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo-% -% d% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option camera filename, you have the option to change the file names in lower case letters when you download it. or in uppercase, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digikam, uses for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your settings to rename are saved and automatically used when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use any information about the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more about the information that your camera embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and when your camera does not supply this information, you can set the photo in its original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select Automatic Rotary in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date the photo was made, you can use it to automatically create subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally off, and in that case, & digikam; the photos are directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the option Date-based subalbums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to their camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, & digikam asks you where to upload the images. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width degrees and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was done, you can open a browser that displays the area with a click. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiist; users who want to locate the location of the photos, or simply want to document just this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, seatposts and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, via post-processing of GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic assignment (manual) and last about manual entry of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">The download of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save these data in GPX format as this is the only format supported by the geographic assignment module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux;: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, then you can use this script working with the Exiftool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals created by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digikam; try to give you as much control over its work processes as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam; change. to access these settings, you must select in the Settings menu; set up. the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or image editing will be set. you will thus set the default behavior of & digikam; fix if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's footer: this field should include the photographer's job title. this can be labels such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the one that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency, such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here because they should enumerate the picture other & quot; anofferquot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the corresponding IPTC field. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the image, and not only in the Edit & Edit Database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & edited without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image labels as embedded labels (JFIF) in JPEG pictures: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appear when the mouse pointer is in the main window over a file. depending on the option selected, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; edited; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to display, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in one & digikam; Albumfolder that has none of these extensions will be edited by & digikam; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The brightness of the & quot; can be set on this page. however, if you then open the illuminated table, these settings are switched on if possible. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one, then you can obtain better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in the image processing, this picture mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression option, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG is using a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can turn on the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this decreases the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the Deflent algorithm works loss-free.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is much better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported, but was in the planning process.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digikam, image editing was just an image viewer for photos. at present, it quickly develops into a tool to manipulate your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor respond more sensitively to ultraviolet light than the pixels of odd lines, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option draws the picture a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is used only if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, so the parts of your images are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to capture the top lights, as they display crisp white. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it displays the highlights in various roses. last, you can try some parts of the missing information from the highlights to reconstruct.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not vibrate as quickly as green and red. & digikam; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should be individually adapted for each picture.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it a bit higher than the standard 1, but this can be done later in the Edit & Edit menu options; to keep the time for the demo icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo-icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA-interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digikam; and Drapw provide you with three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. but it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color gradient correction since it is carried out during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space in the other to translate so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Ask when a picture is opened in image editing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folder Sets the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, in which you save all your profiles. & digikam; then examine this folder while starting.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are just your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should match the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color-mapping or gamma correction. at this time, dcraw Gamma doesn't adjust for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you have to do the mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile, which allows you to emulate how your image would be given back from one device. this is very useful before you can print image, since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not in Canon's models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is naturally unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface you can work digitized; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be edited by & digikam; loaded. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short instructions for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short instructions.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slideshow settings should be easy to understand. the upper regulator adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata into or out, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all the currently supported cameras. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which tries to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture display mode. at the moment, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage devices are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field will only be active if you have a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify here the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / Removable where you mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digikam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitized; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window's cameras. if you own more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving images to the trash bin, you can preview & Edit images in the trash bin. when deleting a photo in an album, you will find more details in the deleting of a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be applied tacitly by & digikam; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without asking questions. otherwise, you will need to save the changes with the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also embed the display of the welcome screen by & digikam; at startup, this speeds up the boot procedure of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting Beim Start after new photos is forcing & digging; to search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digikam;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, & digikam asks you to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & digikam; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from the toolbar design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, please refer to this tutorial for more information.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digikam; includes a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use this to view your photos and start correcting and improving. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry Show / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you cannot recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore button from the File menu or Restore the Restore button in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reverted or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit reverting or Restoring by selecting Edit Resetting from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should use keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl + -Z to undo and Ctrl + -Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the back or restore button in the toolbar at a moment longer, you will get a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and out in the picture by Ctrl + mouse wheel or icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you get into the normal view where you use the Esc key. if you do not want to, you can also edit this in the Edit dialog. if you do not want to, you can view this in the Edit dialog. see the section on setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can choose to print image in the File menu and get the Standard & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire propositions. all image preview pages can be printed out of your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select print wizard from the menu Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The panel has a side bar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in the picture editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear again into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view, you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note the remark below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the labels are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should observe these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the application button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files, but this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting which is always written in the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="359">The rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images simultaneously, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Regency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords employed in this & digitised; session used.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the keyword you enter. you can limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords for a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set in the tree by selecting the corresponding check boxes. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is applied only to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. usually, the left side bar is used with their album, - dates, keyword and searches. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and drop keywords. suppose you have selected multiple images in the main screen to provide you with keyword. if the keyword is already existing, you can simply drag it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter is based on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry searching in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search across all the elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why are Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / Tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly applied it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your picture workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor which is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image issues are via email or the web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should I use another color space and make thoughts about color blurred?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2 dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-Dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, then visit Bruce Wyblooms excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sound my monitor when I decided to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you must sound your monitor since sRGB assumes that your; onitor is on sRGB. if you are working as in the colour space of sRGB, then you either need to use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalization, leveling, automatic leveling and contrast extend from the Correcting Automatic correction try automatically from your colors to make the most. you'll have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the intensity values over the entire image, making the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Same: this method adjusts the intensity index of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation which either causes miracles in an image or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Broaden the contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a replenishment of all values in between. this is only visible with washed images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited because over a color space with 8-bit per color is worked. if you can get too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better off.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu entry Color White Balance of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">In the upper right corner a histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play Anstat with the above checks, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set you can save to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high quality pictures. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the color-color correction menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and also allows you to save them for multiple photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction. in the manual for sound correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">This & digitisation; tool colour effects provide you with four colour effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as Sabatier, was an effect of when one replaced a partially developed print with a short flash and then completed the development of the image. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negative of the picture. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it easy, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it the film of choice for nature photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider refresh the strength of the neon light. in large images the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can use to preview the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you use the button Ok and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse issue: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool scale correction is located for the improvement of the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the sliders for the application purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders are clicked into the image and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to move the knob and to make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is updated dynamically based on the settings of the image. on the left side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it can be set whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma-values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colors can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to interactively change output values as in the input values. e.g., the compression of the output values can be used to create a burned-out image as background while something else is in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: using these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. in addition, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, media and sunshades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows the channel to be specified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Beside this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible. for images with large ranges of a constant color, linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode helps.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, e.g. the bright notes, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding pixels get darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and Load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sunny tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if you find more than one channel overexposed pixels, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & Edit Channel Mixer; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photo.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu Color Channel Mixer of Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed for comparison to your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for the module are lower right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you want to turn on luminance, the picture will also retain the overall brightness as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that comes from the colour space. colour space consists of small space artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any blender setting can save you later and then load them. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator checks all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is stored is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford XP2 Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good, with all scene pictures and fits particularly well into portrait to the sky. so, similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">OrangeFilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscape, maritime scenes and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic sky effects and simulates moonlight scenes at daytime. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">This is very similar to the process of the bleaching of a pressure and the re-development in a squiathoner. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With & digikam; apply tool texture to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or tridimensional structure of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect was applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digikam; add tool box can be added a decorative frame to add a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer within the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier to the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you insert the desired frame type for your picture. the picture is surrounded throughout with a coloured line and Niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), folded it with a nice three-dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the width of the frame is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target picture decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into one image at any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text alignment, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With & Edit; Tool Template you can apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. you must, however, take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the & digikam; stencil database, just send an email in English to the & digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you must set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that mirrors the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder will update the template of the template automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button reduces the underlying image. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the image and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image is then adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychoacoustically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process has to combine colors with minimal differences to a color dot. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG pictures often a camera has been used internal sharpness. pictures in the raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners already apply a sharpness filter during the readout of the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this allows you to use the menu entry Corrected Doing.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should avoid this carefully since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is refocusing the tool. you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is much easier than sharpening it. use the tool for softening with the menu entry Correcting soft drawing and experiment with some settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unless masking is a very good tool to remove sliders from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or the amount will amplify the effect. if you make the Unsharper Mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates will generate close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen images in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference to be applied for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft alternation between the tones are exempted from sharpness and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">This & Edit; tool refocussing refocuses a picture by enhancing the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entlealtungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is the use of a blurred mask. refocusing mostly results in better results than blurred mask. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding works much better than the palatal cleavage. the Gauß 'folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixelae that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna inverse of the palatal cleavage is even heavily influenced by the distant pixels, causing unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should result in 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, and eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. the filter can take values from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will smear the image even further.</seg>
<seg id="502">Palatal sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge. use this parameter if your sharpness is Gauß. this is most often caused by a previously executed unsharpened filter. in most cases, you should refrain from using this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the die can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular sharpness or the gauge. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter that you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all cutting, color and intensity corrections in the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the image elsewhere. the reason for this is that a lot of operations do not immediately make visible changes that are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasent artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">When you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, blurred masking produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by the blurred masking used a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Even under optimal conditions, the result of the FIR Wiener Filters is always at least as good as the blurring mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better when processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocussed image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocussed result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for error correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider controls the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most advanced tool for removing unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various defaults as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine-tune the filter settings, you can use the Tabs smoothing and Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detailing p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and have details sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise, a high value will generate wavy-like patterns. JPEG's artefacts are best eliminated with a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smoothes [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angular step width [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles make a long run time. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stride length [0.1, 10]: integrated stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the higher quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal, but it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to skip it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved to a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts from e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor rauts from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a granular noise which can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">You will find a complete description of all parameters in the following. in most cases, you will need only the sub-window details and the Advanced Settings Window for Advanced Settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor defects cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter is looking forward to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, you may need to re-adjust the edges if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: adjusts edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, it is not possible to remove the entire noise or noise. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak diamond or JPEG-artefact without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either colour or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically smoked. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: adjusts the adjustment of the phase grid attenuation. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filtering range responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high a smearing can occur.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool for softening with the menu entry Correcting soft drawing and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digikam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitised images. the smoothing takes place along the image contours and thereby preserves the contents as it also makes the human eye.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG isn't perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compressions & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that are seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save As and Load buttons make exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original image is under (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photograph that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by the scanner illumination and the photo paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">This & digikam; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove photos that have been created with a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode, since many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixel quot; and "quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and loads it back to the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the broken pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels at a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels at a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photograph, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digikam; Vignettifying correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, ie underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in the medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range. instead, they drop the edges and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 for aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter speed in such a way that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should, also use with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise unsharpening effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and color gradient of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image that was made without this filter. the tool Vignettierungscorrects the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the gradient correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density the filter. the default density is 2.0, which compensates for an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the gradient correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the sliders only provide positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want finer readjustment of the target image, let the values for brightness / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digikam; image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the correction of the vignette applied to the image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the effect of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortions can not be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree handles the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens off at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth grade corrects the distant corners opposite to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. with negative values, tonal distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the strength of distortion fourth grade. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the center of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the reverse sign of the parameter 'General'.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value re-scales the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten up: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box shows the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The sound or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. the best way to perform this correction is first. if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a tonne correction the effect would be obvious to the fallow.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal guide line. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tonne / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove this with the trimming tool in the Transforming Trimming from image editing or via the Zoom controls of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as shots from front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with the hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infra-red film from the GimpGuru.org web site that can be reached under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarot film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters set movie granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add movie granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of the movie granules and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Because the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos, because the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digikam; Filter Ingredient is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grains on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mingle large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless ambiance of everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The regulator can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although frequently higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digikam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digitized; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brush is better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machining is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel big picture is 1 and flatten 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digikam; Filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage. the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized. images of whose gradients are slowly changing are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controls with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper regulator selects the pin size and the lower knob adjusts the contrast (smoothness).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved even further by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; Filter Gravur characterises your picture in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The & digitised; Filter Gravur is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure, in which color is not the most important thing in the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, daring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look like it is considered by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wavelengths 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects take long time to compute and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using Unsharpen effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Insharper: blurring the image along star shaped lines that originate from one center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blur: blurring the image by rotating the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurring the image to generate the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to step back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurred vision: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear motion, z: B: taken from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurred blurring: blurring the image softly in the dark and strongly in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or to add a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaker's sharpness: blurring the image through random shifting of the pixels and simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color pool in the image and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreate it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects take long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural your pictures a wet appearance. it uses a copyrighted algorithm created by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep with & digitized; image editing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. after you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can use it by mirroring or turning it into the correct orientation. you can find the tools in the Transform Turn or Transforming Spider menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the Cimg algorithm used here makes a good job here. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change. choose to change the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is shown below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to magnify a small picture with a better quality then try to blow up the tool.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use some kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm picture bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any photo magnification can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflate is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button terminating.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to put together a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle. you will see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be trimmed by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. create a new rectangle by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is tailored (Ctrl + + X). use the entries file Save or File Save in the File menu to save the newly added photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool According to the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. you can, for example, see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can set the area for cutting to the widest possible, depending on the chosen relation and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the trimming tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables so that the EXIF data reflect the trimmed image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help enable you to hide Help, so that you can put together your pictures better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third angel, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle in a similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden middle: the golden middle is a division that focuses on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who thus constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divide is 1: 1.618 the golden middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides more fluid help lines when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos. in comparison to the third-party rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule are the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to generate the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye drops into the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects. this something can be simply there without guiding the eye, it will accomplish its task.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles are also derived from the golden spiral below. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonic triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal on these lines can be released a static object dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect called dynamic Symmetry. try to place your image focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic partitioning.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the guide lines. if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast, the guide lines can be invisible. this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it happens easy that you do not hold the camera exactly vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned by an angle. you can fix this with the & digikam; image editing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are given in degrees. using the Preferences button, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown to the right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the Transforming Trimming function from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the automatic cutting function. choose one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the picture a bit after the turn. however, keep in mind the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you have to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview is then automatically recomputed. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle at the top left: shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformerted area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformerted area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformerted area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformerted area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments create a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The Schering Tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is no rotation, the picture is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by shearing the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the sea, a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is mostly negligible, but two shots generating twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the scaring, the image has nice triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is to cut the image with transforming cutting from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digikam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. therefore, the available formats depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digikam; displays only files in formats that know. this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, you will edit the file in image editing. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; accept change. in the Configuration section, you will find more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Nearly all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to even select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. this reduces redundant information so as to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossless when specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read in English under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter by & digikam; in the Configuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with & digikam..</seg>

<seg id="726">The project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kprintViewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kprintViewer; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI;. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph in & kates; recomputes the graph and returns to & kgraphically;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & knot; in a & kate; component</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Additional required software: & ktable viewer; is a & kde; program which presupposes the & graphviz; -Tool & dot; for the representation of graphs.</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & ktable viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Recently opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or automatically select this position.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming in both directions is limited by a factor of 10. below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file is changed from another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose to recharge the graph or if you want to ignore the change. & kprintViewer; can also remember your decision so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kprintViewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside of a running & cgraphing; -Install, & eg; in the file browser or from the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & ktable viewer; or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">With the program start you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both save as well as change later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use multiple pages, you can select whether the parts of the graph that come to a page should be incorporated into this page. in doing so, the aspect ratio is ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the particular parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph divided on several pages without header and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load site gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, and eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (recharge or ignore the changes) or query the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphically when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session administration page gives you the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphically. you can set a default behavior (open or not the files of the last session or not) or specify to be asked for each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally with a click in the main window with the & RMBN, opens up additional possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose between different & graphviz; -Layoutalgorithms. the entries, as described on the website of & graphviz; are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of aligned graphene. the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for uncoated graphene. it produces representations according to the springspring model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm produces a springspring model for uncoated graphene. it uses the Fruchterman-Reingold-Heuristics, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm subordinates nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is then executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command you can add & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms can change special options, or even change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the SANE project or another source such as video streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and SANE installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the File menu item, a dialog box appears that lets you choose between all available sources on your computer. select here the source you want to pick up the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducruit values in order to select your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the range to suit your needs before you scan the image by pressing the button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the lower right corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After scanning the scan button, wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by pressing the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after clicking in the Import / Screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen fotomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr makes it possible to send your photos to people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, show photos of your camera's mobile and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication so that it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful login the module can send photos to Flickr website. the following page will be presented after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the Exportiere module is launched to Flickr for the second time, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. at the moment, the module does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button can add photos once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file chooser box. if you click on the Ok button, start uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you change the option Change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the pictures. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI geographic localization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data are stored in the EXIF tags of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools for locating images geographically in the spherical coordinates system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographic data, you need a GPS trace as XML file in the GPX format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical Localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS trace.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the dialog above appears then. to get a possible correlation over time and localization, you must load a track file with GPX file. this file of course contains data recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that displays coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time variance indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data will be merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can edit the GPX file manually and add it to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog is the coordinates of a call to the next one you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the relevant region and enlarge it. repeat this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be manually selected. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that the exigenool is used to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Image Gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs to customize the settings. the tab selection allows to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenpreview and the text that appears in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the picture will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, eg; Dextershow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all of your images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the standard color depth, which naturally also influences the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnail allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Rider for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors have occurred during creation. the web browser will automatically end up to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming, or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for quick picture display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is shown as fullscreen mode by default. this can be changed to a windowed mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing pictures without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases since no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found e.g. in PNG format, for example.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the Metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata. the data will be copied after you have pressed the OK button.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported by writing. please refer to exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Kodierer module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual pictures you can insert a basic image transfer. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You must first select the images that should be packed into the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module from Tools MPEG slide show.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you have selected are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to playback the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the picture transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep as the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all the settings to your preferences, you can start converting the movie with the encoding button. depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that coding or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick Packages using the button settings on the bottom right.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve or print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from him is: expect dcraw not to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file that is to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amps can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same, and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or otherwise use them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format, since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is worsened. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG File in the Exit information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single pictures. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is useful if they were created in a previous attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all the images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images from an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize the image or enlarge it. in addition, four types of image changes are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to customize your image to screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target picture, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images selected by you. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. the last selected image will display a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop pictures to the list of images to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button Remove Images select the selected pictures from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the images you have selected are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure you don't send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used again and again until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your E-Mail Client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After adding comments to an attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under pictures file format and the original files in JPEG format, then the original copy data will be added to the pictures you send.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, in the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be automatically started at the end. with the Close button, you can close this window.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window with questions like you want to have displayed your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions option in the presentation will activate very elegant video transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, as otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The option file name indicates that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The Loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually interrupt it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. thus, the order of the images is not used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the distance between the images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images chooses another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slideshow, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and restart, jump to the previous and next image and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as background for your KDE work surface.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with annotations, you can create with & kphoto album; by these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, thus in persons, places and in group keyword records are present.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you see the categories for which you have entered information as you have added your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails. in the following each is described for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed. by this selection method you can restrict the number of displayed images from a few thousand images to a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the persons, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. they can store with & photo album; however, for each person a separate preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button on the right-hand side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you have to select which image to be displayed for each individual person. to do so, you need to open the picture-view window (described in more detail) and display the entry categories editor in the context menu. here you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the view window you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and thereby select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you enter the search in the main window, you will see a dialog which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the labeling or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total datas, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all images by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here, after pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene are mapped.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kcolor album; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the & kphoto album's home page and watch the Quick Start, screenshots, and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kcolor album; and select in the first dialog the demo if you start & photo album; for the first time, or select in the menu Help the menu entry kcolor album; -demo. then, some sample images will be loaded and you can try the features of & kcolor album; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, please visit the homepage of & kPhotoAlbum, as a cohesive HTML document for downloading.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphoto album; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this list shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">Each bar displays a different unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries Preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview preview) and furthermore the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the time line by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the time line, i.e. the time details. if you select an area, you will be displayed in the preview pane only images of this period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the time bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kcolor album; provides two ways to create HTML web pages with your pictures. one is in & photo album; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & photo album is described; integrated version described, which you can create through the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you have to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout, and target. in the following, each area is described more closely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First enter the title of the overview and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on a photo album; HTML sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & photo album; export file is to be created on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information you want to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are currently being exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not dealt with specifically.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images, so those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 does not need to download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder where all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can choose either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">Once you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start once the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you specify here should be that folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the sub-folder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. in this, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphoto album; you may, of course, create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent quite a lot of time on viewing the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do with & kphoto album; this work does not even make this work.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & Photo Album, you can export a copy of your pictures into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are imported and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file only a link to images is located. the advantage to save all images into the file is that you have all the pictures together and that you can pass this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are found in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, then the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images, which can be accessed from the File Exportation menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three options are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manual option close to the .kim file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file copy & photo album; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size, since the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu... select, & kcolor album; the exported database as described in the description.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the imported images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to import (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to import and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported using the categories of your current database. an example can be seen in the image.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you see pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups. if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps from (1) setting the information about your images, about (2) searching and watching, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. at many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photo album; saves all of its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a disk or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photo album; remark the folder in which your images are stored and automatically used it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kcolor album, you can start with the -c option. for example: photo album -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kcolor album; in the following section of the user manual the various settings are explained to you.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you can see six different symbols that allow you to preview and see the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call the F1 key by pressing a button and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It was described in detail how to define different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">Click on the dialog which is used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options dialog you have already mentioned subcategories. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at one time in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in the section.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list below you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kcolor album; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called through the modules menu. the modules can and are not described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphoto album; they are sold separately. however, most modules have a help page, which you can call via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are shared by several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kcolor album; therefore, you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures. demo database can be called either via the command line with the command &gt; kPhotoalbum -Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kcolor album; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photo album; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: even if & photo album; this type of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order for albums so you can use the features with & photo album.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kcolor album; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, we have to give the modules a list of albums. here we go with a photo album, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & photo album; s browser displays the content of a category, for example all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have specified in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, you will do & kcolor album; so do so if you have selected persons to view and pass on this to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & faPhoto Album are not compatible you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select which modules you want to load.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. at the moment, there is not very much information, as you have not yet received any information about your images. in the section we will return to this window, but now click on the image that shows you an overview of all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphoto album; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown in the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want to see these notes, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">In view, you can see three lists with a text field by defining characters, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & kcolor album, since you will always use them whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and pictured on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons, you can, by shifting the names used to the top, find and assign persons more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the sorting icon on the list below.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each picture individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and provide them with annotations. in this case, simply click the above and back buttons, which are under the preview of the image to the top right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the U.S., and San Francisco and Los Angeles are also in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as a supergroup. to show you that it is a supergroup, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and drop it to make it an subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... that gives you among others the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide the window. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the Display images in your browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have no filter. see here. you can configure the thumbnail size by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview preview. simply select the respective images from which you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit selection menu. now you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kcolor album; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & photo album; namely, images too, without having you saved on your hard drive. of course, you need to have the images stored somewhere, so & photo album; in the picture you can see the view of & kphoto album; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images, in which the right upper corner is cut, are not stored on the hard disk. however, this can be seen in pictures 1-9. however, for the images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so that you can preview these pictures. however, you can also not view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into it. so, if you want to avoid trouble on how to avoid the jumper of your images, please buy a larger hard drive to save all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Image menu, you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end ones you want to make inaccessible and click Current View in the menu privacy. alternatively, you can also lock all the images that your little sister can see, navigate and lock the menu entry All out of the current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">So you have set which images to hide in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry Add images, so that all the images you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the images again displayed, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the pictures. to set up this password, simply select the password in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphoto album; not very familiar with the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you are all your pictures with & photo album; manage and spend hours about hours with it is natural that you want to see them sometime. for this reason, you have a picture _ and video viewer. this allows you to start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you in. he obviously shows the picture, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, e.g. who is in the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the info box on the top part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with the mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right-click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene selected.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have multiple images loaded in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by jumping the picture up and down the image. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kB album; then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus. start and stop the slideshow by pressing Ctrl + S.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & kphoto album; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer will use the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button you can zoom in again with the mouse. the Plus key zooming in the center of the picture. shows how a zoom angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key, you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the equation button sets the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that come in and out are with the plus and minus-key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">Use the context menu to turn the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image using the menu item annotations from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view further images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you watch one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to provide images with features while you view them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. see a picture in which the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, they are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add all of them at once with annotations. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to make.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen. if you can display categories in the front view, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to complete the Painting Mode of & kPhotoAlbum, select On the picture paint from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an already selected object, as all sub objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either on the icon in the toolbar or choose a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following pop-up menu appears to allow you to choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene by deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; -user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already includes the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or a part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as presetting the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a point of view as a wire model. you can indicate this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the viewing stage selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window configurations and easily switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the beginner in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from anchoring, drag the beginner to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left at the bottom line.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view click on the small cross in the first bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu you can find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any location.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... Save. it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on the Rendering icon The symbol Renders in the toolbar or choose the menu entry View scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">Render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or in the View Render Mode menu..., the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but sense is a name that lets you recognize the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box sub-section and enter the picture section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these pictures often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the influence of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">When you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is split again and again depending on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam of pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the default threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are tracked individually and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental characteristic of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection is calculated. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays did not hit the object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly quit, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select the Import menu entry... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; if error messages or warnings appear when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this includes the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can paste source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually, this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation to the displayed object. set here the path to your retention and the version. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you also need to add the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the checkpoints. the second color is used for displaying selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects, such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">Cross extended projections are all projections with exceptions to perspective and vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross walls, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross soil, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the bottom is represented in a checkerboard pattern consisting of two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more detailed information on the parameters can be found in the Render-modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window configurations or create new window configurations. in the section window orders, it is explained how you can create and save window configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window arrangement: shows all existing window configurations. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The existing window arrangement lists all existing window configurations. a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement. new views can be created by the button Add and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New Column, create a new column on the right of the existing windows, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tabs you get a card card view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you only get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit. that means you now have a scene with no objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows just how the camera sees the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera. this shows you the result of rendering the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later guides, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired place.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the Apply button or Enter the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endless Body Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply or Enter key. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also shows the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite level. when you render the scene, the level expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor when you click on the + in front of the object. you will see then the different parameters of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and displacement. select one of these options, change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First choose the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something multiple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can choose how to insert the object. please choose first sub-object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = floor pigment), with a click on the thumbnail preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matte black material because you have to enter settings for the pigment yet. therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you preview not a color on the Quader and Ball, click the Apply button and then call the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now adjusted correctly. if you now render your image with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. here are further settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree select each time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the Apply button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you shifted the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already in the ground, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first sub-object and change the name for example in Ball Pigment. click on Sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the Enter key.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The gloss effect and reflection gives rise to partly good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even when metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two dimensional picture of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will see nothing without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that needs to be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. any changes since the last saved version will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last returned command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Editing Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you can find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the keyboard shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option pre-set short instructions for & kpovmodeler; modify commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up toolbars. with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to pretend harsh surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed in either a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files you can click with & LMB; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window or if all images always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, just type the first character of the filename in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner. if a matching file name was found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Settings - & kuickshow dialog; there are five cards. in three of them, General and editing and slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two, short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser, the keyboard shortcuts can be set for each window.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, then the images are opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. presetting is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is enabled, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you still have to look at the current picture. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option you save the Dextershow; when you exit, open the name of the last opened folder. at the next start, open & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored beam to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can create & kuickshow; set up just a few of the file types that can display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Determines if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">To change the value you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slideshow is repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field. the default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Here you can change the keyboard shortcuts for the different operating modes of & kuickshow; in the flashcards short instructions for the display window and short instructions for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">With this option, switch between the two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and the one-part view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>
<seg id="1146">Displays large icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short presentation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">Displays small icons for the files in the folder. this display is only possible in the short presentation.</seg>

<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface from Amarok has many general functions that can usually be found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok still has its own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback when the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check your script to see if all the required modules are present and use cdialog for the user to know why a script is not running.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and steer Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in every KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. usually the exec () function is used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. to do this, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and respond accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Weist the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok will set the working folder to the folder where all the data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is played. the script could now & zb; use DCOP functions to query more information on the new piece (for example the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths controls the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. submenu and itemTitle are also given, so that the script can be used to remove the clicked entry. to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal is sent to the script. this signal should be processed in order to do, for example, clearing up data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packets are basically normal Tar-Archive (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name as e.g; amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly see the archive as a Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the amarocscript creation. for that reason, you should name your script packages properly.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1243">Amarok just needs the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a little guide on how to compile kdelibs minimal.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager binds the relevant standards of freedescaltop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will provide for example trouble. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelbs and Qt, because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by checking in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org and also append the broken file that caused the crash. after that you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this bug to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, compiled with GCC 3.4, Taglib but with GCC 3.3.X, this will crash when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd, turn off automatically if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by E-Mail (the e-mail automatically opens on a crash). if this is a frequent crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the Meta-Info, but they do not mark as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer device with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for ALSA (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and solution. for GStreamer, you may need to provide another sink (e.g., for example, in a sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">Do not forget that media must first be decoded. you can't simply send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer Driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Sound Server with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player also has & Amarok; a player window with the most important features. additionally has a playlist that is superior to all the others. the playlist window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including the creation of a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the current play or the current stream. directly below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already elapsed playing time to the remaining play time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player window contains a selection of audio analyzers, also under the running text display. you can switch through the available Analyzer by clicking on the area with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, magnifying window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also displayed under the running text display. button PL activates or deactivates the playlist window while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the piece-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous play.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio operators. there are 17 presets, from classical to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you mark the equalizer check box, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all available multimedia players. it has many features that are not available in any other player, but don't let the wealth of features cool off, they're all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be split into two main areas, on the left is the navigation pane. in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use, but even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information about the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, Text and Interpret. these three sub-windows will be explained later in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the Start window will drop. the information shown there will now be distributed to other parts of & Amarok; the information can also be viewed in the Statistics window (Tools statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running song, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. the title contains the name of the piece, the artist and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you can find more information about the current piece. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and the last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current one. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play instantaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music subwindow. with the right mouse button click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual areas to immediately start playing. you can also right click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the text subwindow text, the downloaded song text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages using self-written scripts. once you click the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which one to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics text. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database. there is no running text script required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com named after the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - group only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - At first the pieces are sorted by artist and below is another split after the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view on your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sort by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically among each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but it is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine grouping exactly as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-record your collection as soon as you change something at the selected folders. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection field, with which help you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can also select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. you can also select your entire collection, which makes the filter shut down practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This lists the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order into play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. double-clicking on an entry will give you the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set the pieces in queue - This function will insert the selected pieces into the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the media player in the queue to transfer them to the media player. see the section about the Media Player Browser for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces will be sent to K3b and burned as either data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option will not be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - opens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) Move files to the trash bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select the compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it will appear among different performers.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Picking up a compilation mark - Change a record marked as a compilation back to a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under different performers, but again under the corresponding performer.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser provides easy handling of many playlists. among other things, it also contains intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlists browser includes the smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created Smart playlists are possible. click Add smart playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod, it needs to be listed in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by interpreter sorts in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is completed, quit & Amarok; and solve the disk connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Below the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. search is useful especially in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musik.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than it is in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it. in this case, holding the Shift key may be helpful: this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place and drop them. once you enter the letters, only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed, which contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms separated by spaces, you will search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two, and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing whitespace, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that contain Mike Oldfield, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: assessment: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific keyword, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that contain either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key and then click the entries with the right mouse button in the desired order. the entries will then get a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left you find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore, allowing you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, enlarged Analyzer. the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as the one shown in the player window over the right mouse button. through this menu you can set up and Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example rendition checks and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total play time of each piece. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval can be easily changed by double clicking in the corresponding display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu.</seg>
<seg id="1404">A click on this entry opens the window visualisation plug-ins. there you can select the visualisations from & Amarok; select.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a submenu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what to view in the cover administration. choose from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue management received your big move in & Amarok; 1.3. with this function you have even more control of the playlist. after you have set a piece in the queue, the playlist will appear in the list next to the title. this number represents the order in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 is played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>

<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge recently opened projects. the corresponding sub-menu includes a list of these projects. click on one entry to open the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Save the current project. once the project has been saved, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new filename.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new filename. KDE's dialog Keep under will appear with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Save all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project changes and hasn't been saved yet, asks & k3b; after what is to happen. you can then choose between saving and change. furthermore, you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>

<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b; for each unsaved project is asked what to do with it as if you had called the Close file.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you access this entry, you can select files to add to the project using the Add Files dialog. this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files appear in the basic folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Opens the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the project's properties dialog. the only difference is the additional button burning, the & k3b; for burning the medium causes. the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Open the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of them are described via the What is that? help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes files from a previous session to be imported into the current project. this is useful when one compiles files for a multiple session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this feature is not used. it is intended for you rather than help in order to see the files and folders already present on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project. this function causes & k3b to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function removes no files from the medium, it only displays the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">Open the CD-copy dialog. it also allows you to copy a CD to another medium without the project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD which you then later burn. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. you should prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It also allows you to create a copy of a DVD which you can then burn later. additionally, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. additionally, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of the normal copy. the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported, so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source media in the original form.</seg>

<seg id="1470">Open the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which completely erases the contents. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously selected DVD video can be converted to this dialog. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the Table of Contents, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings, and even possibilities to change the size and cut black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted media. this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes features of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of tool bars of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">When this is checked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents are shown in the Table of Contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information, locking and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View lets you select and drag files into the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head bar is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headboard has no real function, it only looks pretty and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box to change the keyboard layouts for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can adjust the allocation of keys to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. therefore, system administrator privileges are required so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Open the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be done. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is intended for customizing and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more comfortable program kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, therefore your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the accompanying programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b is started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP functions, which have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features like copyCD, formatDVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD () void burnCdImage () void burndvdImage (CURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, one gets a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively one can get a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project received by using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (Qstring name) void containing void addāle (Qstring path, Qstring parent) void rent urls (Qstring path, Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString Quartz) void setups id (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts the files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataPrice Project) dcop $PROJECT createFolder review dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder review / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& audio-creator; is an audio CD; -reader for & kde; with it can easily be audio CD; s can be read and stored in mp3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on encoder which is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& audio-creator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders who encoding these WAV files (compression). currently lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These Kodierer packages must still be installed from the Linux distribution). additional encoders can be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the title of the & CD; read out and saved to WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3 or OGG format or also in other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this needs to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. however, all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to install the Kodierer packages that are needed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction to encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to bypass any copy protection mechanism; just avoid purchasing copy protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While the setup needs to be made only once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), then the daily use to read a & CD; on the hard disk explains. this (hopefully) leads to an understanding of the slim approach of the user interface that you often stumble across at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; obtain information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, all of which is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window's commands. on the step by step, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request from CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet needs to be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. it should be noted that before the encoder was configured in the Settings dialog in the Settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager to select an already read file instead of a full & CD; read and encode.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of alerts (such as logs, tracks) for program events (like read out the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Open the main configuration dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different card cards (such as Encoder, for setting up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey ', which may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate, the differences are less important since both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still provided free of charge with most distributions but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high audio quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playing equipment is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be listened to on other devices such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto hi-fi systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list with parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for additional parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo hi-fi systems. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. requires less than 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all tracks of a song. good enough for music of youths, portable devices and autoosteron equipment. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information entered manually or automatically fetched from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame the switch -tt of lame and the title Parameters of & audio-creator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audio-creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs that can download / enter information, so that all the others can download this information rather than themselves into the calculator. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces, etc., not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: that's the author) bin not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway on a bumbleby a & CD; shop, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & Audio Creator is set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia will be used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. please note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this has not yet been done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be added on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder packet must be installed by the relevant Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. more information about encoder is in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, more information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the writing and reading rights to it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed. this could give a hint on what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the CD; this won't be possible!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you are using other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we'll use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You must have cdparanoia and lame installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section discusses the basic set-up of & audio-creator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read out a & CD; what to repeat for each reading & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to use for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy, we share the program to download the freedb from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them every time you read a & CD; if you have found the appropriate settings.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Please select only for incomplete information so that you will be notified when data is missing to generate keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The map CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and release the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the & CD; to access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection box is easier, a & CD; entry is found, immediately start reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory name or file name will be changed with Konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to enter everything manually, disable the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, you can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database previously. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first one. the mode is set on the following card.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for calling the & CD; information from freedb server over the internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section about freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we have not downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both function equivalent to the server, as many firewalls use the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send any data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously missing pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? paralleles reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to discard the & CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as already mentioned before, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and the output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of wav files encoded at the same time: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine it can be attempted to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just have the basic set up of & kaudiocreator; quit. this configuration is used as a standard for every read of a & CD; if you have cleverly chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section describes how the process of reading the & CD is running on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built up as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb must be picked up.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not included in freedb, the screenshots look a bit different from that for a & CD; with successfully fetched data. therefore, you will learn to enter the & CD; data manually instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example is to be found. it is a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not yet been done, the & CD must be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, then browse the section Questions and answers after the Help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully fetched from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; key for your & CD; gives, a window is displayed and you can select the database entry that best fits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the internet, you need the connection to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD Editor - entering the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Actual Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist must no longer be entered in the 'Actual Title' field, unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. all words with uppercase letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have set unlimited field length, at least on what & audio creator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later anytime with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. refer to the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the exit CD; in this example, this is not important as we don't transmit the CD; data anyway. for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The CD Editor window appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data, which we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next row in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line turns the selection of the piece into or out. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All Pieces button at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">When clicking on the selection button read the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab Orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is just read on the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will see you when trying to work with a encoder you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked whether you have write access to the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus read out and coding in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. in case of low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. however, most distributions already include a pre-compiled package, as & kaudiocreator; a part of an important & kde; install the kdemultimedia package from your distribution. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at persons compiled by source files, and not for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various card postcards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any indication of how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD; in the drive), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no email. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or modify something useful, may do it. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore in agreement with this proposal.</seg>
<seg id="1615">Strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from & kde; SVN, then you do not need these information, but...</seg>
<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others it has also some features with real-time graphics and karaoke real-time highlighting of texts, which other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS - and & kde; support. & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphic display of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (song events or textual events). kmid automatically calculates the process used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. if you want to quit & kde; when playing a song, kmid will start with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog whose help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window into the & kmid; window. this also works with several songs simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button Abplay in the toolbar, select the entry Cancel from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece automatically starts as soon as you pull it onto the & kmid; window. (in case of several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece plays, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">When you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the speed display to change the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure acts on the space bar like pressing the button pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use texture events, others use song texture and other both. some pieces do not have any text: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically determined, which a song is used, so that you do not need to manually set anything. so, if you activate the Auto text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text is automatically selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the menu entries or the song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played in series. in this section you will find how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the Collection Manager. this can be found in the collection menu under the point Organize.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original one.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the one you want in the Collection Manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection gets all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember that if you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Adding to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If the Automatically add to the collection is not enabled, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click on Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row after from the submenu Remove from the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the drop down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To continue a song, select the Next song button, select next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return the reverse a song, select the previous piece, the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow key to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the Collection Manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is not saved when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the Change patch to Trumpet type, and lets you hear a trumpet when you originally play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all required conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an email so that I can offer support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you specify how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">For example, if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun. to do this, insert the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with patch 127 (rifle shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term Drum patch of the patch, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how tones are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as is their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are mainly used to map notes on the percussion channel. take a look at the included key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply type in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a given channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword is used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that attempt to change the patch on that channel will be ignored. in this case, patch x will always be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates the ratio of Pitch Bender events to be multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender Event with the value n, this is converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM provides that a keyboard that receives a pitch benchmarking event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards attempt to play two notes up to an octave higher. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; play around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a given channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob is no longer green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. the View menu can be selected in the Settings menu under the View channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">For example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Well, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file requires 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to remove the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't feel like adding all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">For this reason, support & kmid; drag & drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Check Activate Automatically add to the collection before. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; - windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, only switch to the & konqueror; -windows and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to quickly listen to a file without adding them to a collection, turn off the Automatically Adding to the collection, and the new one; file is added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. first you just want to play the first file. so set the Auto Add to collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrostr.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; MÃ ¡laga. at the moment I'm doing a bit of time for my hobbies, but I try to collect MIDI files, make music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">You really get a lot of joy when you send me a postcard from your home or an MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will record with friends by & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and got money from anyone. I would like to emphasize that I only use it because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">Thanks also to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Marc Diefenbruch, Peter Gritsch, Magnus pepper, Urko Lusa, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheim, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, thanks to all these excellent musicians on the net, who give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition to this, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located at http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at pictures. you will also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you use an FM radio device or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid with the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not hear music.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; -mailing lists or send an error notification directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SME; is a simple user interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or Phonon, as well as for playback of DVD, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website on new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is only displayed when information is to be returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Temporary Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click an entry, its group and all its sub-groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by directly editing XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & SME; not running. simply click on a name of a category, select it from the View menu and select the next editing mode. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML content of that part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select the playlist from the playlist menu and select either the edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost if the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & SMB; some features can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation for starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be simply inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate a different animation. & SMB; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / SPlayers / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / SPlayers / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start-up does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening a different source. however, this would be annoying in the end-animation, the user can therefore end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; / smiled; & lt; /</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & SME; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the 'Console' button in the Toolbar of SMB. here, the output of mplayer is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this playback device in the configuration dialog of & SME; everything must be configured by editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, just like setting up the backend by mimetype. here is an example like a 'flash' playing with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SME; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & SMB to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & SMB module must be specified as a service provider for the application / x-shockwave flash in the configuration dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & SME; is to be started in a console application and to browse for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & SMB; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that always a given backend for a given mime type is taken (of course only if it has been determined), you have to do this by changing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file. for example, phonon should reflect all the ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port is to be used. there, ports should be detected, of which one is selected. the encoding to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains dvd in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR support from SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of Video Devices under Linux is the only one that works). that's why the videoforlinux extension for the X server must be working properly. for the XFree86 server, therefore, the following must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of making this documentation this is dvdnavy, dvdsource, exitsource, introvert, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional writing application. among Unix-like systems is likely to be reverted to the package & texlive; or & tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components can be included in the used & Linux; distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & kile; project contains some already compiled packages from & kile; for different distributions. these allow easy installation without further compiling and are included on the kile; website.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with & latex;, & kde;, & kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users hardly have to read this manual. however, all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact over the kile; website should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If questions arise or when compiling & kicking; or if extensions are desired, this should be addressed on the mailing list kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; & kile; offers the possibility of using all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within this one simple, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex; programs. furthermore, the easy-to-use assistant, the & latex; -Reference and powerful project management.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works using the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For natural latex; is the correct language: Lay-TECH. while the original & tex; difficult to use, a layman can also use a lay (close lay) & latex; -Makros. a less sophisticated but realistic explanation is that it originates from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While only a good overview of natural latex is given here, it is not the ultimate book. to be able to rule properly, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex should be used: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed again with the\\ end {document} command.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Introduction Wizard of & kile; is a useful feature for fast creation of a document in & kile; selecting the wizard (menu) offers some possibilities for creating the document. you can also set some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this defines the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [letter], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], foil [Prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: with this the character encoding is set. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of natural latex; -Documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used additional packages for latex; for the integration they must be selected only in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), letter (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always find use in the creation of German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry now. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& kile; provides - as well as other source text editors - the highlighting of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). through & kile; if you want to see more complex areas of a green text on the screen, it is probably noticed by the modest appearance of the output file. however, it will save you time and time by highlighting.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With automatic complete execution of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) from & kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to lay down the command (e.g.\\ end {command}). this function can be kicked in menu settings; set up LaTeX commands.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and subdivided the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">When viewing the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating one's own & latex; files, the back-up search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file is created (English e V ice I nailing file)], jumps & kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer on the corresponding line in the & latex; -source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the available output eart of & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing of DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back search, the elements of the DVI; file are buttoned with the editor and once on an element in the DVI; the source text is jumped. the default search is the exact opposite of it. once on a section in the & latex; -source text, the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer is jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document, work is simplified with other .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set project settings for project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick Construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed (unless there are any errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">Video surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is based on the 'unused', and there is no call from & Okeyepiece; after the quick installation.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be showcased. the selection fields have been developed for quick integration of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for quick breakdown of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; commands for subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is available for inserting items such as tags, feet notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a designated term (selection above a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are appropriate editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last field of selection with the name GrÃ ¶ rens is used for determining the font sizes. you can set the font sizes for the main text, the joints etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two options are available: 1. the assistant for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from the ground up with the hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The braces according to the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font sizes. if font sizes are not set at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex can be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the MenÃ ¼ s construction or the button fastener.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if this is not the case, the logging should be followed automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report is created with the font size 12 and only a few signatures should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} enables then the change of lettering within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only secured inside the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no narrowing (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain types of fonts, bold print, cursive print, subsubmissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the cursive pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in one sentence can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex is shown, a step-by-step guide for the creation of a document in & kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments for the better readability of the document should be made. to do this, there should be a quote, a few passages in bold and italic pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, it can be returned to the editor by means of editor view or Ctrl E (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English e V ice I ng). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file, the same steps as for creating the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. once the DVI; file from the & latex; source code has been created, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The search option allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position inside the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& kile; offers a corresponding setting for all & latex; -bindings. to do this, you just need to set up Modern under Settings...</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to perform the search, the mouse pointer needs to be positioned in a line of the source code and click on the preview search. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; the viewer then takes place.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & Okular; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; -document of & kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. for this you need to set & kile; in & OkPlease; as text editor.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If an error occurs when using the Fast Construction of the & DVI; if an error is present, it will be displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file tells the error source in the source code. in the editor you can then use the Preferences LaTeX error and the first LaTeX error for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the incorrect line, the error in the logging must be clicked and & kicked; jumps to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once the corresponding button is clicked on the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the pre-set possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be re-written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document. more information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Hands-free users of natural latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created in & kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be opened or a new file created. & kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a file New, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile...</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can choose your own template instead of the default ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files will be created. if a simple way is used to create a template, it should be searched for one on the internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kate; as internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu tools directly from & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called over the MenÃ ¼ help LaTeX reference. it contains a valid description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that by clicking on\\ par of\\ par\\ bigskip only\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with the Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& kile; has the possibility to search and highlight the most different types of source texts. for example, the natural latex commands differ; -Commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional jumps. these are a separate type of bookmarks in the text. the MenÃ ¼ Rouge edit hocks or the corresponding push-keys allow the jump to the next or the last jump-mark. thereby also this jump-mark is highlighted, so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & kile; although & kate; already excellent options have been added in & kile; important features for writing a & latex; source code are always supported & kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include a text with continuous lines (as in other text editors). this extended meaning concludes tables, and latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. the only worsening thing in & kile; is that the items are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word below the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also contains & latex; commands with a back rule (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To remove part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the Ctrl + K key to remove the entire line. & kile; offers with its own commands for faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition of a paragraph in & kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore offers & kile; for more orders under the Edit surroundings for a more simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the start of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command will jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environment commands, the above overview can quickly be lost. this command closes the recently opened environment, so that the nested surrounding structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; -groups which are determined by clasps {...}. under the Edit TeX group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the start of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command will jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front of or behind the curly clip of a & tex; -group #, then jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups braces you can quickly get lost. this command closes the recently opened group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple quotation marks are used as a binary. for the purpose-to-use implementation is used in & kile; the sign "for two simple quotes. also for the end of the application the sign" is used. & kile; knows this case and provides two end-to-end grant signs for natural latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic insertion of the double suit characters can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in specific settings (e.g. ngerman or french) and thus German or French suits. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift + Enter key & kile; an intelligent line break. if the current position is located within a Listen environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & kile; not just a line break but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Complete the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line break.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or custom environments. these can be kicked under Settings; set up... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables -environments and thereby all Et characters (amp;) among themselves. & kile; tries to make this possible. although this tabulator may not belong to the next tab in the above line. although this tabulator may not belong to the next tab, add some space for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already offers a good source code completion, this has been added to & kile; to provide special commands (mostly for natural latex;). there are three different modes of operation. all of these modes can be set up for different working methods under Settings Kile... Complete set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">Start a new environment using the\\ begin {environment} command; automatically add the\\ end {environment} command after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last character of the input is removed and, as a result, the list will be removed. on the other hand, the list may also be reduced by entering a further letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command. alternatively, can be added by & kile; also jumps can be added, so that a jump to these positions is possible by editing the hock brand NÃ ¤chste jump mark and the desired parameters can then be taken into place.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Among Settings kile; set up... kile; Convert settings can be made to these lists. you can select different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; -Commands as well as books of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the enforcement mode call will result in a large list of ambient commands. on the other hand, environments are used so often that & kile; a special mode for completing environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the complete setting of the complete environment or the keyboard shortcut Alt + Shift key, the command to start the environment is automatically enclosed and it appears\\ begin {. after that, the environment can be continued in the simplest way and terminated by pressing the input key.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a Listen environment, will even include a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Among Settings kile; set up... kile; Convert settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of termination mode for & tex; - and & latex; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& kile; supports user-defined lists of abbreviations, which can be replaced immediately by dragging strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Box... Kile can be set up. as an example of a crash list, the file example.cwl, for example, contains the L =\ LaTeX entry.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word comprehension mode is initiated by the menu Procedure Editor or Ctrl + Alt whitespace, the character L is replaced by the\\ LaTeX string.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large containers are not helpful for automatic digestion. however, it has been found that many more users in a document are written more than once. thus offers & kile; the completion for all already written boards.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu box... Kile can be completely deported. here, the threshold value for the display of the complete compensation can also be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The complete files can be installed in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / the Persian home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation (abbreviation), dictionary (dictionary) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The Graphics dialog boxes the insertion of graphics as easy as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as popular as PDF files, but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is needed, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools can then be converted with ps2pdf to a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">To examine the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the tools are grouped in the menu to compile compiling, create conversion and create view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the further conversion can be used by key single; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file by means of old; 4 the DVI; file can be viewed in a PS file and by using Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Quick Construction command, a viewer is usually called after compiling. if no built-in viewer is used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project is about the Project New Project.... herewith the following information is requested for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilopr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The script function of & kile; allows to execute ECMAScript code. the scripts can be managed through scripts in the vertical bar.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be modified in other versions of & kile.</seg>
<seg id="1861">First it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in & kile; a system-wide object (= kile) with the following methods:</seg>
<seg id="1862">& latex; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a large number of additional packages. & kile; offers a lot of different aids to support the users.</seg>
<seg id="1863">& tetex; and & texLive; provided with a lot of documents. this includes a documentation for the included packages and a further & latex; reference.</seg>
<seg id="1864">This is not just a description of all programs (but a few important packages are described) but rather is a complete manual for the & latex; commands included and is therefore ideal for searching for a particular formatting. since this is a very large document, it is divided into three important bookmarks.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Due to the quantity of documents with which & tetex; / texLive; provided, finding the correct document is not always easy. as possible help offers & tetex; / textual; the small application texdoctk which contains a database with all documents and graphical supervisions.</seg>
<seg id="1866">All documents are divided into categories and the greatest advantage is the search for package names or strokes. from & kile; then only the results are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1867">Double-clicking with the mouse or typing the space bar opens the viewer for the document.</seg>
<seg id="1868">& kile; is a quelloff and user-friendly & latex; - / tex; -Source editor which can be executed on all systems with installed & kde; - and Unix-like systems. & kile; is also part of the Fink project, allowing & kile; also on & Mac; with OS X installed.</seg>

<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plugins without a location use & quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often working on a project involves several people in a kind of hierarchical relationship to one another. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift + F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as both team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can select himself from the list of team members who he is. this happens by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the Setze. the currently selected member (her identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the setting of one's own identity are important in terms of news and annotations. see further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event can be created for information to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later, if a file is saved, or a script that plays a file in CVS, as soon as it is added to the project, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">Events can be created, edited and deleted on the Event Configuration of the Shift; F7 project project settings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressee selected in the receiver list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project manager.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Enter comments is simple. you can either select the note entry from the editor context menu or insert the @ annotation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Notes can be sent to a specific member of the team. in this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), where nickname is the pointed star of the team member, is part of the project from the following possibilities: the corresponding area or sub-project leaders should be given according to the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are independent of upper or lower case, but whitespace around the clamps and the: make the note invalid.</seg>

<seg id="1948">The settings can be set up by setting Quanta... to be called. this dialog covers some pages that are dealt with one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal Groß / lowercase means, the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal Groß / lowercase means that attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, for tags that the closing tag is optional, this will be inserted immediately after & gt;</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags except the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end tags automatically: if enabled, the corresponding closing tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding while typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. by means of the Standard Reset button, the defaults can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise than files opened with file opening (where the encoding of the file can be skipped), but this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that in case of a power failure or crash the document can be recovered from this backup at the next start of the program. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to look at the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the default settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface is messed up by modifying the modes and / or appending views. it corresponds to the --resetLayout command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning messages area is used to control the possibility of switching warnings from non-demand warnings.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The location to change the behaviour of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source text view in shared mode.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree showing the parser nodes in the document can be set in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, it is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structure Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep when changing the structure tree can be automatically opened. empty nodes are empty areas in the text while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The section for setting shortcuts (a type of templates) that unfolds when editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause cut means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are Kpart-applications from the third page, which can be reused by any part-capable application, the most well-known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be given:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read-Only mode" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Read-KParts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; if the entered information is correct, then select the entry if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plug-in concept was implemented that allows different implementations about plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, supporting the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable Debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a Debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all the holding points, with time numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is produced, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugger's requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so normally it does not have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugging session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution continues. if it started before a debugging request was started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a Debugger request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script, and if possible, it will be corrected in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and proceed as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale as well as this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>

<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s. tag folders contain two file types, file descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. tool tracks are handy, symbolic-oriented lines of image buttons (above the editing pane), the text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for conversion details.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; for the tag. file descriptionnc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow for quick inserting tags into a document without any risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is presented in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as a mere element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used & lt; attr &gt; an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Describes an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>

<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a section name and a method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container day grouped together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Sets the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tag that is to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a day. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt;, especially in elements like & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause any leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check tagXML. another dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check is performed only when the TagXML files are loaded in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Below is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Below is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>

<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for manipulating DTD Edite DTD. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP file; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD specification. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set by setting actions... created. clicking New action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the Custom button a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. you can insert a text in the detailled settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that change the document or use (or parts of the document) can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. in this way, the script tries to find the script at the following locations: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; process. if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; from the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be entered by & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the input% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, directed to the standard error output. it can be specified which is to be done with the output written to the standard output, by setting the output selection box:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a tool bar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. press the New action button at the bottom of the window opens the Edit mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill in all required fields and add the tag to the matching tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable "Edit Tag" dialog when available so that an input can be entered while using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels as default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the day start, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green it is usually perceived as loose, stared, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled by clicking on this symbol; startgt; -tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with Settings Select actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are any, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the tool bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar setting dialog on Settings Toolbar. make sure that the desired tool bar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to preview the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all the symbols to ensure everything is working.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the right folder. after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the right folder. please adjust its file descriptionnc; so that its toolbar (s) is loaded (s) when a file is opened from the appropriate type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user is the possibility to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository check if someone has done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; -language. then you have to create the docrc file. the first part is left to you, the second we will treat here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example file documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Tag 1 = tag2html tag2 = tag2html tag3 = tag3html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own contents. there is no known boundary for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the Table of Contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folders will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to create context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation should be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would appear directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file link lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements separated by comma (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used for the & quantaplus; -community. you will not be rich, but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failing resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an email-send menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with email, tool-like tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all other & quantaplus users can download them. the contributions are reviewed and made available only if our team considers them to be correct and useful for publication. in order to make a good contribution we recommend to sign the resources for which there is a GPG / PGP key. thus, the origin of the resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialog New resource the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and by clicking OK the upload must be started.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP) menus, upload tool tracks, and start the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examine & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to automatically convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert menu of DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that you want to use. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP file is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folders.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Defintion Line: the string that appears in! Doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: if enabled, brings & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus; therefore, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to explain these concepts precisely to them without their understanding & quantaplus; little use.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment at the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local items represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; -mutsters to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the joint use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the tabs with info and the toolbar. please click in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all the trailblazer, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document contents, such as basic processing steps (Cut / Copy / Paste), edit the tags, mouse-cursor, or open the file, if the string under the mouse cursor is a file.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the editors of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as standard for which a set of tool bars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and associated user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbar buttons is really easy. if you want to insert a single day, such as & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. now you can insert the data for this just added day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog with different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate through the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open it and roam. in the presentation with tabs, for files, projects, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation construction views are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions like add, remove, upload or delete files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on where they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the corresponding user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration in Global, Local and Project works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the right mouse button, further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or send it by email.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an element, a list of commands appears in relation to navigation and refresh of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it manure can change attributes and namespaces. the application system aligned with the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on the web technique for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be attached, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and any changes to the DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar by email. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load it in & quantaplus; like any other tool!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the & quantaplus files on your system. therefore, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus; you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH before your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While attempting to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, extensible Markup Language editor? well, this would make it the most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then should & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; development community based. & quantaplus; following, in good application of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; framework, it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and tool bars, automation is possible almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for a fast web development and quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detail documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpachhelp: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard in & URL; -write, which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost, to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or from. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of the & Shift + button.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; -script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches for a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a sort of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Turn on and turn the bug report at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter will be activated as soon as you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries previous or next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. then the selected files will be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows you to copy, for example, graphic files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in the chapter & quantaplus; projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of tool bar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be set by setting actions... can be added. tool bars are stored by tool bar tool bar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the disk. if you have not saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps the & quantaplus; -team, so that the toolbar is present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables upload of tool tracks to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; makes sense if the entities are to be refreshed from & DTD; if it is global and if there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current Tag Settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the smart insert of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML-DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by a tool bar is denied if this tag in this place contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed among the menu items listed above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemata depends on the file type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Choose the type of line identifier. very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Check the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries the switching can sometimes need time or cause uneven graphics. recommended is the card card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu includes an entry for each open subwindow. with the selection of an entry the corresponding subwindow is activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Sets the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add which ones you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project, e.g. after filling out the project name. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift + F7 project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, the file is filled out automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj).</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you will find the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.pix.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the tool bars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set rather than the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Leave if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be mounted. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact selection according to Gutenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This displays a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the subwindow profiles or by Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the desired debugger. currently, only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Upload Profiles (see in), as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by adding a separate tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can activate event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior right now.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">If & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button is blended to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programming. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the disk save option is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address function.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for upload. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (locally) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be easily read, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool tracks. it can give many views in a project, i.e. through simple exchange of view various files and tool tracks can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible from the Toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As already mentioned above, tool bars are stackable in & quantaplus; best viewed through the toolbar menu. usage and addition differ. adding tool tracks is treated at the bottom of the section Adding workstations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons can be set using the context menu (right-click on the tool bar), in which new action can be created, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as tool bar can be removed, tool bar can be renamed, or toolbars can be executed where actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and action will be displayed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The tool bar and the actions on them can set up tool bars in the menu with Settings... and set Settings...</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially documentary skeletons, code snippets and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you provide for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions introduced at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. pictures with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information on the template tree is available in.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. based on these templates new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template, but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire web sites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and choose File As Template Save As Local Template Save....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save Selection as Local / Project Template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and dropped to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">Binary templates are simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this, such as dragging and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file tree view, you can click a folder on the right and select Site Template, enter a name for the template and secure it. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pre-empt headers and footers or dynamically associate with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / DLL and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To set the behavior of a folder, click the right mouse button on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled when elterable attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">If a root folder were set in such a way, it would deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in the case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or illustrated text for templates in this folder. this could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows you to add a whole presentation to a folder with special headers / footers in a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Additionally, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one location to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor which can be reached via the View menu. first mode substitutes the source text editor by the VPL; editor and second splits the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document that contains & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; -Source text. it is not possible to edit it directly using the VPL; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. by pressing F9 this mode is active, this mode is active, the button of the button moves the active cursor from one window to another, keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable via Settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL; you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculators and a large breakdown for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the tools document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called when a new document with the VPL; editor is created.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click into the list allows to change the contents, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key word 2 on the contents column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or remote key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way using the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool bars like the table assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. you will be later in & VPL; work, in this release, the tables or lists must be used tool tracks.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. unlike other programs for style sheets, searching for certain elements is possible and the style template can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To successfully compile & xsldbg; still need the libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already available for a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools to compare. so why so & kdiff3; let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes while at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it into the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function changed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two persons work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time shows the result to be expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you to merge and merge the entire folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder Merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and denotes the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often have to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more annoyance if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other is different in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can facilitate typing by simply writing the filename of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Knot 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder folder 2 folder folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The Open dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog tells your selection and displays it next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By pressing the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for goal and can be edited. however, it is not strictly necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would only need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; now you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can remove nothing from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line in the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, you can see at the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. that is good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line is displayed on the dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording Volume:, the filename and [Geographical] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons jump to next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, every difference is at the same time a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no more line is left in the batch by automatic merging or by editing manually. this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your mind and perhaps yet again choose another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a tag that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The Text & lt; Confusion Conflicts; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy this text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if you choose to ignore the numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page, page, beginning, end, Ctrl start and Ctrl end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all the windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the summary and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / first / last difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Image Upward / Ctrl-Image Away) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Paste). if this option is enabled, you will automatically copy whatever you mark, automatically copy to the clipboard and skip the manual copy. however, be careful with this option, because you might inadvertently overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems do not use backspline + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 preserves the line-ends of the source files, therefore you should not use them with binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the last used files will be saved automatically when you exit and restore it to the next start. (set up Settings &gt; &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the chosen font does not support this display, nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be scaled. on these systems, the Button Preferences automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when the tab key is pressed. otherwise, a tab character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press Enter or Return, the previous line will be automatically applied to the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each option is automatically copied to the clipboard. you do not need to copy manually into the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer for saving. the default value is the commonly used selection on the used operating system.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. even when merging white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' r 'and a newline'\ 'at the end of a line, while others only save a newline character'\ '. if this option is checked, the car returns will be visible, but this option may be disabled. during merging, this option has to be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is deactivated. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow to very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be shown before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic Selection also applies to conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapters on scanning of folders and performing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and an older version already exists, then the original version of the suffix .orig will be appended. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further fuse.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not apply to the current program. you need to quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is not available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the encoding fields for the encoding, a quick reference appears, which is the local coding. (this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file coding for source files. this will affect how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">When you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, they may not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress revision of changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded keystone column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will appear next to the normal yet another oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you would like to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply remove the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu, even if you compare only two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last file used will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function, e.g. for cutting off disturbing parts or for correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal pre-processing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it himself. however, the good news is that in most cases, sed or perl are sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command line to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an ergulary expression that fits all characters in a line. the\\ 1 in the replacement string refers to the found text in the first clip pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use a few keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all of them follow the same sample $keyword created text $. now, a pre-processing command for line abnormalization is required. the\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _\\\ _ BAR _ Author\\ _ BAR _ Date\\) is needed because $is a special character and would mean the end of the line.</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experimenting with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually a built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line comparisons. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi-cleared.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs a few details. where used\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the preceding'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line interval is seen.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hide differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can easily compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the suggestion before starting,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays simulated changes without really carrying out them,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the file dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder has been specified, use the folder 3 as the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not merging. to start merging, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared to that point will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">If the scanning of the folder is completed, shows & kde3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is normally folded up. you can unfold a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions, all subdirectories can be opened and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or unfold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">Double-clicking on a file will start the comparison of the file and a comparison window will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The name in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detail window to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically chosen. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are regarded as identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green then yellow and later when it is old, red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if A is a folder and B file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronised. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action to ensure that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible filename for the output file only B; directly after merging & code3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option to select Save File instead of merge (uncertain) is enabled then an error message appears error: files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not fixed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">When merging, a file is executed after another. it indicates Finish when merging successfully, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is completed, you should make a last check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column will only be shown when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected item (file or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then it is used as a target in the Three-folder Merge mode, B is selected as the target, and A and / or B are used as a target when synchronizing A and / or B.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all the entries that should be in the destination folder should also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: start / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut) to merge only the current entry: select Run the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If illegal merge actions still exist due to conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all the entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Saves and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then performs certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, choose to restart / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then leads & kdiff3; its work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you breach an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list, you see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been combined individually, these entries (in the current session) will not be combined again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered settled. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit onto the specified pattern are displayed in the elemental tree. multiple patterns can be entered. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .cg; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .cg; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autymatic generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set specific to a .cvsignor file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a preceding dot designates a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">For links to folders: when the option is turned off, the symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and checked recursively. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in a continuous loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Perform a complete analysis of each file and display the statistics columns. (the number of deleted, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders via a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this advantage will cost you a certain degree of security.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to Trust the Change Date. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the modification date. please use caution. this option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the Synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging will be selected in such a way that both folders are identical. also, the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off by default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as an action instead of merging. (this is considered unsafe, because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is shut down in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another one, then the original version is renamed and gets the .orig. if an old backup file exists with the .cg extension, it will be deleted without additional backup. this also applies to normal merging of individual files, not only the compilation of entire folders. this option is switched on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder view is visible in the merge of single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want it, you can disable the Option Directory & Text window and switch to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. nevertheless, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder. to do so, use the current file merge from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be set to first and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote computers.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">For example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it can't be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then, a file is assumed as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change-by date. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is possible only for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select in KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files. if it is used as a KPart, it takes & kdiff3; then the input file needs a patch file in unified format. then the file names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & kdiff3; the program patch to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview into - KDiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & chdiffusion is executed as part, it only supports the comparing of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I've been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in the default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE can't find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kde3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines disappear next to each other, this is the right attribute but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor remembers each difference in the files where it begins and where it finishes. this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly, No src is left; the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors for highlighting differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kde3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found under http: / / kadmin @ sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">In & kde3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base directory of the & kde3; -distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, refer to the README file for more details.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems when compiling. however, if you encounter difficulties, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Removal) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) adds the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all files do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the labeling A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the rows are already present, they will be removed when clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">By default, this option is disabled. differences in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated as differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktops, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background by & Kpager; click on, the context menu has just the two entries Pager... and ends. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager; in addition, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, Windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is checked, in & Kpager; the names of virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is checked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, and eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this box is checked, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is checked, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty working areas are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program windows. icon displays the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here, the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be specified: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as well known from Pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal row and vertical right in a vertical row, which is very well suited for displaying on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the Pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. in addition, it runs out of the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right click inside & Kpager; and set up selections of switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or refer to your system administrator. in this file you need to enter the key windowClear mode and assign it to this one. possible values are:</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor is harming for a while at the same location. it is intended to help people suffering from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and that any mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain that arises when you click the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, if you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that occurs when you click with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movement and takes a mouse click once you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move is activated, the mousetool gives a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be stored after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligentes move is switched on, the shooting time is activated (1 / 10 s). here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button, wait before pressing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking the mouse shift. if this feature is activated, a slow move to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but the first time is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can move & kde; go to the & kcontrolcenter;, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slide control sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently available only under & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already clicked the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last press of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing is to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later add the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should make yourself aware of what places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is rolling you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located on the sides of the hole into which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can be easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the smart move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be stopped by letting the mouse button down.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to run mouse clicks and place the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray surfaces around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I do not manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to mark text, copy it into the clipboard and insert it again or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using & kmousetool; use it as follows: hold a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold down the Shift key while moving the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will each time, if & kmousetool; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the move time starts when moving smart. later, you can use the intelligent shift even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to be able to use the Xtest extension for & X Window; this should already be the case on most system.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and these are correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button once the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI's syndrome and those suffering from the pressing of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time that a drag procedure starts before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping using the mouse can also be performed.</seg>

<seg id="2595">When you click on the Speaker's Leader in kttsmgr, the Postcard Holder will be displayed. it will also appear automatically when you start ktmgr and not yet set up a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2596">All speakers already set up appear in this list. the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list. the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2597">With a click of a mouse, select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list.</seg>
<seg id="2598">With a click of a mouse, select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings. see below.</seg>
<seg id="2599">With a click of a mouse, select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down. the order of the speaker in the list also determines their priority.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current & ktts; system.</seg>
<seg id="2601">Choose a voice type here, there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girl voice to choose from.</seg>
<seg id="2602">Click here to see the new speaker on the Postcard Speaker. to change the settings of this speaker, click Edit.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Now you can use & ktts; almost use. go back to the map Generally and check if voice output is enabled (KTTSD) is enabled to make the TTS service from & kde; see. now you can use & ktts; use to create and manage text orders.</seg>
<seg id="2604">If you have at least one speaker set up, you can start the language dropout system by & kde; click on the Generally tab to open this card. here you can set some general options.</seg>
<seg id="2605">Select this check box to activate the KDE TTS service (KTTSD). this starts the KDE-TTS service (KTTSD). if this start is successful, the card card is displayed, and you can create and read text orders. see. remove the mark, KTTSD is stopped and the TTS system from & kde; deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="2606">If kttsmgr is terminated, runs & ktts; on, if the field is enabled (KTTSD) is enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2607">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr will appear automatically in the Control bar's system area when reading it, it disappears as soon as the preview is completed.</seg>
<seg id="2608">With the buttons in this row you can start, stop, pause and record text orders.</seg>
<seg id="2609">With the buttons in this row you can read the current text in the & kde; clipboard or open a text file for reading. you can also switch the speaker for an order.</seg>
<seg id="2610">Click Apply or OK, then all changed settings will be taken on all pages.</seg>
<seg id="2611">The Order Card orders will only be displayed when KTTSD is started. to start KTTSD, click the General tab and check the language edition (KTTSD).</seg>
<seg id="2612">In & konqueror;, the web browser by & kde;, you can read the text of the displayed web page. first check if & ktts; runs. then select the text to read and select Tools Text in the main menu. after a short time, the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2613">It is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website. you can also skip this step, but then many & HTML; -front lines and other invisible brands are also read out.</seg>
<seg id="2614">In & kate; the advanced text editor of & kde, you can read the text displayed. first, check if & ktts; runs. then select the text to read, and select Tools Text in the Main Menu. then the speech output should begin.</seg>
<seg id="2615">This also works if & kate; embedded in other applications such as & eg; in & konqueror; or in & Quanta;.</seg>
<seg id="2616">KNotify is & kde news system, notifying you of events that you have specified. you can also read & drop the text of this news.</seg>
<seg id="2617">In & konversation;, the & kde IRC program, you can set up various types of messages. you can set up & Conversation; for example, set up that you are notified when a message appears in an IRC channel where your nickname occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2618">Supports a & kde; -program KNotify, a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program. the possible settings for KNotify differ depending on the application.</seg>
<seg id="2619">The file kmail.xml, which is part of the scope of delivery of & ktts, is a good example. it removes the tags br and b from the messages sent by KMail, and additionally the expression / local / inbox, since it can be accepted as presupposed in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is processed before it is sent to the speech-dispatcher program. it is useful for the improvement of pronunciation to replace wrongly spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of voice synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the "speech-dispatcher" program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. if the output of Screen readers is read-out, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">News have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses news. while you & eg; read a long text on a web page, you can arrive at & kmouth; someone who just enters the room. & kde; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order you create from the map sheet is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are meant for the output of longer texts that do not possess any particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four job types are processed in queues, except the output of screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this output is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there can still be more types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String replacement parts replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; provided with predefined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; converters use a XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. included in the scope of delivery; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; if you have set a female voice for example on the card card speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules to apply for a speech output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text assignment, message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all the activated filters set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are deactivated from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the further below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set up string replacement filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison patterns. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it must differ only from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column Errors. the list is executed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. load a list from a file, the entries are appended from the file to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here. click on the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl key at the mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs can be obtained with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box DigiesFilter apply if all the input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all the texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">By comparing words, the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. thus, the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions, you can call it in the dialogs Add or Edit as help to put together these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; converters translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the auxiliary program xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, also xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the Speaker Selection filter, you can send text to a specific speaker, or a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts from kmail should be read from a female voice. see.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text is sent to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that sets the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card board. with the speaker selection filter, you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the entered regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the properties of the speaker you want. when the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to best meet the required requirements. click on the button on the right to display the speaker selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your speech preferences or to delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box DigiesFilter apply if apply. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde;, with which programmers can give their applications TTS capabilities. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, which can be added to KTTSD with the voice synthesizer, so that you can use this synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a brief description of the & kde; -DBus; interface of the voice output API from & kde; see the full documentation for both APIs on the kde; Accessibility website (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2666">I have set up the & HTML; -XML; -Forming filter, but when using the module for the festival, web pages are not read.</seg>
<seg id="2667">Due to an error in Festival 1.95 beta, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone for Sable to work at all. you must also do that by yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found via the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain signs or punctuation marks appear to cause errors in the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only gibberish is spent. what can I do against it?</seg>

<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE source code archive, you can download the package declines with & ktts; from it. you can also find the source code from kdelava under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It contains many languages, a list of all currently supported languages, can be found on the project page http: / / espeak.sourceforge.net / languages.html.</seg>
<seg id="2674">American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibibio.</seg>
<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any voice synthesizer that can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. see also on the webpage of ktts; for information not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The "speech-Dispatcher" program uses a customizable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ttt to use another synthesizer, please contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; but it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc with apt-get install xsltproc.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current KDE development environment (version 3.4 or newer), including packages kdelibs and the development files for the "speech-dispatcher program."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have downloaded the source code from & ktts; from the source code archive for declines or download the tarball that has been created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use it, first check whether speech-dispatcher works correctly with your voice synthesizer. you can use the shell script spas-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts, which uses the speech-dispatcher program. the kttmsg program should be developed in such a way that the implementation of speech-dispatcher is directly possible and the spit-conf script is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can return propositional or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If an application gives text to & ktts, it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. for example, if you have set up a speaker, whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best suitable speaker will be selected automatically. if you want to know more about how & ktts; a speaker is selected, you see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click on Add Speaker on the map, and in order to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the map Speaker setup will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, just enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. for voices known as dictations, this setting is automatically made. in general, Western languages are used ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select a few controls and display them grey, the chosen voice doesn't leave these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices need several seconds to be loaded on account of their size. when you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so (with bigger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or forget to click Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window will be displayed at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol kttsmgr will be visible in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to view the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr runs not yet, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders are listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently processed set.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this series, you can proceed in advance or return in the order that is selected in the list below. (but not every order is made up of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking on the OK button, all changes in the settings (also on the other card cards) will be taken over and ktmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this tab you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted from a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops them. once the Screen readers output has been read, the retained jobs are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this stage is important news such as & eg; processor gets too hot. a warning will stop the output of messages and normal text. these orders will continue after reading the warning.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard includes brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. abbreviations. SSML is a part of the voiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, SSML supports only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) since this is the default voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100gr;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monoton.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Encoding = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! Doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech synthesis / synthesis.dtd "asked Mama Bear. who slept in my bed? asked the bear boy.]] &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set limit detection filters (SDB filters). this can start & ktts; faster with reading, since only the first sentence has to be synthesized, not the whole text order. thus, you can also forward or pause orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is automatically set up. you can change its settings or add other set limit recognition filters, but beginners will not be advised.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the speaker selection by selecting it. turn off the speaker selection and enter text to read. check the selection of speakers, change some features and check how the selection of the speaker is changed. of course, you have to set more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with reading, because only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can pause or break text orders on the map sheet, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit detection filters compare text with a regular expression for propositional characters and insert a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard layout recognition filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit recognition filter, you can insert it again by reloading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection menu you can override the subscriber settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the topmost one on the card speaker). in other words: no speaking abilities are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the features of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, then select this speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the properties of the speaker you want. if this feature does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should have priority over other properties. you can also set several markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the issue of output, it is always treated as the primary feature. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is present when you know that a particular application sends text in another language other than that set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the speaker area, which most closely corresponds to the following, click on the default spokesman and then use the speaker closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number, input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr runs immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and tracts; it has been terminated. GStreamer 0.8.x is the command gst-registers-0.8. if the problem is not resolved, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is possibly installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; a message appears that says: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, see the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr shows this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festival.As a guide, you can use the other entries. if that is successful, please send a patch along with the URL you found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and located via the environment variable PATH. some SynthesizerModuls such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card for speaking devices a setting for speed. depending on the chosen voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML Converter filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I do not manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker but & ktats; read the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that Festival does not produce errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags to convert SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>

<seg id="2762">Have you downloaded and ttt; as tarball (tarball-packed archive), log in as normal user and unzip the tarball to a suitable folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have runtime dependency of non-free software.

<seg id="2767">CD cdecimecho kttsd &gt; inst-apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you use your synthesizer, first check if your voice synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions that you received with the synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS Synthesizers, its source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good and multiple voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help you find the instructions provided with the Festival. if you would like to read web pages, you must install the (male) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices, you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes Festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / right / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to enter the voice MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a kyrillic (8-bit) coding like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">Festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for Festival first on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to a 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; synthesizer. then Festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; it generates the audio output from it. the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that & MBROLA; no complete speech output system is. & MBROLA; generates voice from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival generates these from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also generate from German text diphones. more information can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this procedure, additional Wrapper code will be added to the Festival to use & MBROLA; voice synthesis notes. note that the & MBROLA; voice files will not be installed in the & MBROLA; folder, but in the folder festival / lib /.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German & MBROLA; -Voices. required is either festival version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install festival and & MBROLA; then download the MS German Festival from</seg>
<seg id="2780">Instructions can be found in the README file in the package you have downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0, playing the bug fixes is not necessary, you only need to recompile the festival). add the following lines to the file festival / lib / siteinit.scm.</seg>

<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffered voice synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you must install the & Java; Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; you can set neither pitch, volume nor speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any voice synthesizer located in a command line, can be controlled from the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav) rather than sending the output directly to the audio device.</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; to manage network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings will be displayed at & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Settings in & KMenu;.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot be installed. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured so that & knetworkconf; the device at all displays and allows setting of the network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and set up when installing and installing Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Settings module is loaded when the Network Settings option in the & kcontrolcenter; index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which best fits the distribution and the release state. by selecting the setting not-again-questions, the definition can be hit permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be considered, changing is not possible. in system management mode, click the button system management mode at the right lower end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In system administration mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are shown. from the tab network interfaces the following tasks can be performed:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of the network interfaces displayed can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button interface... can be edited in the Device dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to open dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">With the automatic mode, TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be executed at the same time with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start, so no further setup is required. in the selection list either DHCP or BOOTP server, according to the system, can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manually you can configure the TCP / IP configuration without DHCP or BOOTP. in the IP address input, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask entry field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as the properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict. with ping in the & console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or switched off, depending on your needs. switch-on of an outdated network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or switched off depending on your needs. switching off an activated network device can be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Sets the IP address of the host in the local subnet, which mediates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the appropriate IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name into an IP address like 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the name resolution makes it easy to manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting an entry, or downgrading in the list with the Hinds or Heron buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking on the button Add... from the group Calculator for name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. then the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">Select one entry from the group Calculator for name resolution and then click the Edit button.... You will see the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name specifies the name-to-IP address reference for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for boot when there are no DNS servers available.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list contains some known hosts some entries that support & apos; localhostakapo; and some specific IPv6 addresses. this still under test will replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the well-known computer and click Add.... Add New Alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click the Add button. if the known machine has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Converted Calculator will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">You can perform one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network Settings module are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command needs to be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it's easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case the installation of Qt and Qt is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second chapter all of the configuration files are discussed by & knetworkconf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is mediated into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being run with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never been widely distributed. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future. therefore, this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in external networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point for a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small network, the IP address should be selected from a reserved area specifically reserved for that purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, you can access the Internet for such machines by adjusting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own machine). the default route is required for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The power address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to an own loopback interface that works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it is not surprising if there is another content to be found there in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another state than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar that additionally offered the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second objective was to answer a question my wife asked: how much longer does it take if you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be mounted by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; returns the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the band. recognize & dat; the pretension on the tape do not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Know & kdat; the advance credits, it searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the belt index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched by folding the entry for the band.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the belt, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; indicates by a change of the symbol for the tape to realize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat; it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not match formatting at & kdat;. if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can format the tape from & kdat; however, floppy disk drives usually require formatting the tape, DAT drives are not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, continue & kdat; with the formatting of the tape. all data on the belt are lost thereby! after completion of the formatting process the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you must select the files to be secured, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be saved.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be saved.</seg>

<seg id="2915">Before reconnecting, the files that are to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Recover from the menu....</seg>

<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to re-create the tape-index file by means of the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this band. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured will be automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up on the same file system as the folder. folders that are on other file systems can be registered separately under backup files. each file is viewed by tar independently from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are saved.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">This deletes the snapshot file from tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of buttons files & gt; & lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings through the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the instruction mt load is loaded to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is switched on, try & kdat; lock the throw at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the integration of & dat, the band will be ejected automatically. do not use this option with Floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, try & dat; to change the hardware-driven block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must inform & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should contain only one memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the complete name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the band was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the file $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are just tar archives, which can be handled directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work unless they are incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for System Logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various log files. in addition, & ksystemlog allows for quick access, for example, on information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified presentation of the log files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the various log files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence, try to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog provides functions that easily filter and sort the single protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup tried & ksystemlog; first the most important log file of the system - the system log - to open. if you don't see it, and it opens a small message window, you have not started with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in the / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter by a selected criterion or entered strings. enter a string into the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system protocol, select the process column, and in the filter bar, select the name of a process, and then indicate the name of a process in the filter bar; all the log lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. level errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as minutes lines of the Level Note. the colored display of log lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the Process column. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the To Show new lines in the Main Window's context menu to display all new notes in addition.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you can find more current information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; can also be found in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops to the standard for control of program starts when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go down here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary file is under / sbin and not on / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to change a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD-Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to run while uploading the system or switching to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d on the one hand if you need it. most systems own this file, even if there is not much use for it. you may also put a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something on boot, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. in the beginning area you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have confused something, then you come to repair it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be invoked with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server run level that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; furthermore, I could also have a user Runlevel, which & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: just drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run levels to launch it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between levels or modify the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you move them to a new level. in order to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you explicitly need to select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed previously in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorbet number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the entries before attempting to add the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present, there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working ranges (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl + X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (with Ctrl + V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard running leveling, and now the machine is constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be OK).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; to run under Runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are launched in these distributions simplifies the configuration for proprietary configuration programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check if all the configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not available or false.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The significance of the & Linux; runtime varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runlevel so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adaptation from & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save button in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two tabs, the user group and the user groups list. to edit, select the user or group you want with a double-click on the entry. it appears the user and group properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have wildcard limitations (quota) enabled for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD implementations.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card will appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD implementations.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if there is space limitation (quota) enabled and initialized (identifiable by the quota.user / quota.group file system on the file system). parameters can be changed here for each user, whereby the space limitations are in KB in each case:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be individually set for each file system. the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The tabs groups provide information about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, you will find in the field Primum Group. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by marking them in the large box.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog box contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user on the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
