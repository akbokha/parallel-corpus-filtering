although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I also grew up with American movies , have d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and operated their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , revealed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if this was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sentim@@ ental love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless people have re@@ acted to his statements and tuned in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won with the republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and its voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which assimil@@ ates people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps also agreed not to agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as her son .
she still suits the dedication of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , their wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love toward America .
while Tr@@ ump took his way to the nom@@ in@@ ee Republi@@ can candidate , they offered me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency gave a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
categ@@ or@@ ising people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and in@@ tim@@ ates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
could it be that those voters , most of whom are white have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to ex@@ alt a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( e. g . Ü ) : as much as &quot; le@@ aning against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; pu@@ n from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ plas@@ h , as the big van Jones called , has just killed what America has done so splen@@ di@@ dly .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have , America is welcome everyone .
for this country elected as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , a huge part of the White American promises this promise and says : hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole notion of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who died in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your amer@@ ica ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your amer@@ ica ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he received a coherent and loud &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , just 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for a number of years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ al violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
once they get out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always arrive laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from Wa@@ ste
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village that is practically on the top of the biggest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials are made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the Recycl@@ er , under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , has begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic violin , viol@@ a , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of the tr@@ ash .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ aya and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the litter The children didn &apos;t know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children .
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something that he had never seen before : a tr@@ ash produced violin .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of re@@ processed material , called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmonic land@@ fill ) records the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and of him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even performed its music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can effectively fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats illegal illegal fishing .
this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical environmental problems .
the re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the joint use of content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in the Liber@@ ian waters of illegal fishing before it searched for the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law @-@ break@@ er of this kind at their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seych@@ elles soon mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ ap@@ tise one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then exp@@ elled from the waters of the region : he did not succeed in catching fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of the pl@@ under@@ ing of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , established in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had exp@@ elled from their waters at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand each other where illegal fishing goes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Fund En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support to F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to detect . in this way , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , for example , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during port inspection .
fish @-@ i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to design@@ ate ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship is loading their caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a criminal record .
countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay taxes , as in the case of prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $ 20 million of lost sales , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering Eastern African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which attracts the region &apos;s commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , specification of fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You must not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
the closed front has been working so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake lic@@ ences in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide .
&quot; the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support .
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oc@@ e@@ ana Marine Protection Organization : a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide using the position of each trac@@ table ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gathering with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also sc@@ aring them off .
ships that used to be conf@@ is@@ cated without licence and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have meanwhile increased a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia , the inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing networks , whose use is prohibited .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting the illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; safety is the aim of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; Cop@@ eland says .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s latest member state Somalia was able to report its first great triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship travelling under a false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without licence and were used drag networks which are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal against illegal fishing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans is actually working throughout the oceans . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles will appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they act as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empty space by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the currency translation of Venezuela ) , both demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centre @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation is wor@@ sen@@ ing continuously , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the everyday life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines .
many representatives of the opposition have seen the opportunity for fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; but ultimately , the holding of a new election has been blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the context of the Government decision as follows :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % relative to the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment for many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( for example : round Table of the Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , urged the demonstr@@ ators to stand in the way against President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . &quot; in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , should continue to exist .
the appeal was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
so far Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil stri@@ fe and on November 3 all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .
keep in mind ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Cy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
the first demonstration during the action programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 .
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government .
one of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that tell of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to his own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , several demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear coats , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ di@@ sts do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic is already making the round , which maps the amount of repression per day :
thus dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ten@@ dering procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your ministry !
on the road !
others analyze these protests as a further step in the fight against a government which , from their point of view , has done little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to let critical voices mu@@ te :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches are increasing in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview from Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 in D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
now in the context of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba , Qui@@ j@@ ano said against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , examined crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division of 141 in prison La Per@@ la .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archive recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who was charged with ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows what great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
they called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
just make sure they don &apos;t take you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , a revolutionary People &apos;s Army , the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told me I would become secret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it would be fine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for so my Father had refres@@ hed me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the military base , I had to cr@@ ush the papers which had belonged to the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get out . he led me to a bar@@ racks in which cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - were simply everything possible .
everything from it was stolen .
he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were turned off and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I pe@@ w@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
they seldom bon@@ ded a person with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ flowing him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .
photo : Com@@ isi@@ ón Provin@@ cial de la Mem@@ oria
the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wound .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ?
&apos;@@ I knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore eye binding .
he spoke with &quot; chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied up with hands and feet .
in the vicinity of the entrance cla@@ d people quietly on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when my father re@@ marked that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like this , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me here ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beat and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to data from survivors , the ci@@ vi@@ list Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , followed Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina &apos;s students to death ) .
in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the path you came in here is also the path on which the duc@@ ts came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be la@@ yed .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have taken from an enemy you fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the head of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , hit me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I &apos;ll find you and kill you personally .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like this .
I have no one good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to cancel .
&apos;@@ the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last ou@@ tra@@ geous act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but what would the cor@@ p@@ ses leave ?
why do children ab@@ duct ?
one day my father brought a girl home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ se is the last hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous act that a man can do .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course anything remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations for him because of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience for his sake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they claimed were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally spoken against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 off@@ ences : under severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed by following death in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child .

the sentences in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ e@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ e@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish .
after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses have been heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 cas@@ u@@ alties finally in August .
the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Perm &apos;s verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Sil@@ esian Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory conceived by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years for justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 1995 , Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organisation , H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who advoc@@ ated the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process took more than three years , but the search for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot;
the sign with the translation mistake at a center in Kyoto , where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence , were witness@@ ing a particularly mis@@ erable translation in the last month .
the Japanese word was written on a shield ( kor@@ ak@@ sha &apos;s sha ) , which means &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ sts , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil ul@@ ter@@ ior motives &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ ori@@ sts . &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
edit the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been shared in many social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which appears in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bad English translation was first removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , even though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation mistake . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the ap@@ ology as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that elderly people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of elderly drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers , who are involved in accidents across the country , is quite a reason to worry .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , Senior citizens caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has fallen in total , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named Repor@@ ter published comments on the light showing the prejudi@@ ces that some Japanese apparently how@@ l against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo with the translation error has among other things the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; aw@@ ful car &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How bu@@ ggy is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

there are many reasons for the widespread dis@@ semination of translation errors .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could make translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that even have no foreign employees let translations be done in @-@ house . then the Japanese employee , whose English language is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic pro@@ positions which arise through machine translation show that this technique can not yet be replaced by a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or governments that have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
hopefully the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more rep@@ utable source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : taking the protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and on television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ ajo con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later on other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV are no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also carried photographs of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and deleg@@ ated the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the link was cro@@ pped and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : enables your VPN to be activated .
it seems that Internet sites are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been reluc@@ tant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the T@@ elecommunic@@ ations Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ in@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique whereby the DNS servers respond to requests for certain domains .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds un@@ fail@@ ingly or den@@ ies the request when making such a website .
we confirm your DNS @-@ lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the broadcast was stopped on Thursday 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who survived the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was det@@ ained .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on air again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina is fighting for children &apos;s rights and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ s who have been victims of abuse and discrimination .
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . using the kind permission of the tur@@ ban .
the following article is the shortened version of a report from the general public , published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , she referred to the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift .
this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta , generally guarantees silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
there is , on the one hand , the family , whose daughter is in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is ab@@ used , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of strong stro@@ kes . shortly after she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military officer Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra was hit with a stick on Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela den@@ ounced the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered than children , &quot; says T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to trial , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín may be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to trial .
the daily life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ ans are exploited not only as labour , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik , in which her father worked , had to log in bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in her employer &apos;s house Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge , &quot; she rec@@ alls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read the editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the host had found someone to listen while talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; learn bad habits &quot; there again . &quot; this meant that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belonged to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ í back home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible .
she was , however , completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; a thing that is almost never spoken about are bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ anes who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to go home . I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly clear that I was not a group .
the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning personnel and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact you .
starting Monday , if possible .
the display received five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the dis@@ col@@ oration of the ad turned out again :
dear friends , I found one . I look if it works with her .
thank you very much , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .
in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , as long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we managed to aboli@@ sh systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , while the Spanish Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í ) and the indigenous population ( with whom the workers as half @-@ slaves ) had to pay tribute to them ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the workers as semi @-@ slaves ) went into a system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the display of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ six Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulations regarding the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it is adopted by the Parliament , users of social media must register with a government agency in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter .
on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to allow citizens to use social media .
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video surveillance and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be en@@ forced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ations to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I strongly doubt the technical capacity and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they can control forci@@ bly physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court case .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed with the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ised and ensured that no devi@@ ating narrative is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment for those who were found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ards in war @-@ drawn Iraq

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the Ti@@ ersch@@ ut@@ erin H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who ro@@ am through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat as they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular species of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
as R@@ aza appears in the video , &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera hall , R@@ aza boun@@ ces out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza likes to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing protected areas for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper in Japan , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the disaster .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture still had a nuclear accident , which alone had to leave their homes for 16@@ 0,000 inhabitants .
from a local point of view , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the housing construction site in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replac@@ ements were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , and 80 percent of the planned replac@@ ements were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the final light .
nevertheless , even six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated dwell@@ ings were ev@@ acu@@ ated ( to put cas@@ et@@ su u@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final replacement parts .
after the thre@@ ef@@ old disaster nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
nearly 40 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma were still living in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees , who lived after the disaster in shel@@ ters , were moved to final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ects concerned
as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has been able to determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have re@@ opened its doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have suffered tremend@@ ously in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far removed .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dw@@ ellers , it is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to as@@ certain a complete picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local people and among the ev@@ acu@@ ees . it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sense of feeling had changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper writes :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed believe that there is still insufficient evidence of disaster prevention .
how it is about those who had to be ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had to experience .
of 160 000 ev@@ ac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were res@@ ett@@ led to permanent replac@@ ements .
more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture are still living in 2017 .
in the disaster areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centres are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater than the common ground .
after a while , however , one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important because they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind ourselves that the world is ultimately very small .
as a result of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak to five Global Vo@@ ices members , remember@@ ing a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love of music over@@ came the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she has collected with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in an artificial coma after being beaten by the police in demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had him beaten up against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures throughout the country .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a head@@ stock . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active service .
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his head@@ stock on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed in the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s hurry to him shortly .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police force . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
by : editor Vil@@ ela . release with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further violent attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App @-@ group joined a gas leak . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care station after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a head@@ stock .
police Cover@@ s
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were in the centre of Rio de Jan@@ eiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the member of Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has tou@@ red street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were reporting a broken glass window in order to visu@@ alize their title pages illustr@@ atively with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window disc than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of property damage .
here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines called &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
villages forgotten by the de @-@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba shut the doors ( Photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding the fact that there is no notable harvest of sugar on the spot .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after exhaus@@ tion , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long period of in@@ active time are in operation because they were received .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane plant would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the municipality saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
between 2017 and 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must be between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if present production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this day will certainly go into history &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; these were the first words of the Cu@@ ban president F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Per@@ ez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he &apos;s most repeated is &quot; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of the Jubilee , the first letters began to come .
these were officially recorded documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently .

the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace supplier has been extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , no alternatives for the work places and services generated in the communities in which they were present were created .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in use for five years , everything would run well .

after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to un@@ block it , they also stopped to asp@@ ire to the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without any work in the region , and with an already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to find other factories .
they became spare parts .
with no prospects for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , the production of which is not even used for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .

first Nations young people use Hip @-@ Hop to express themselves and maintain their own culture
record of a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young@@ sters of First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it by means of Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have direct mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e hip @-@ hop group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
the workshop conclu@@ des that the young participants in discussions discuss topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway der tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely un@@ enligh@@ tened .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of global@@ isation .
many of the songs were published in indigenous languages , although the you@@ ths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the youth involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a verse in Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dial@@ ect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we as youth have lost our way in life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I believe that we will rise one day .
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also go ahead of our youth
this is how they can do what they have done to the Creator .
in the commentary section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to Sil@@ verb@@ ank ( which is also published on his blog and re@@ published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( to be used ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( to be used ) , &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i there are a large number of small companies that produce precisely those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them any more . however , a new trend nowadays turns them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger featured a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile hand@@ bands decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few sho@@ ck@@ up fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an aw@@ ning @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ wort is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; w@@ ow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with salmon s@@ wind@@ ling ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ comfortably .
our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ strips of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes you can watch yourself at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # to be used to do a range of hard @-@ to @-@ do .
if you &apos;d like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ash@@ i , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the Mis@@ sing and Get@@ ting went out on a regular basis only in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Ch@@ apo Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely repres@@ sed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
behind each body , behind each bone bust stands in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is supposed to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffi@@ ckers and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
a video titled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; changing the life of fear &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , for the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
on October 15th he should be back , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are insur@@ ing my father &apos;s insurance , but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate .
where should we get them ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for a number of years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resist@@ s or is sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ cker ) when he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; fe@@ ats &quot; of the perpet@@ rators when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous . &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the post of &quot; Four months ex@@ tor@@ tion in the Capital District : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were squee@@ zing money out of their business month by month until they were destroyed not only in the business but also torn apart their families .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain never passes away , the trauma remains , fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers also .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will dec@@ eive you or kill you .
in these terrible days , I wonder@@ ed if weeping would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega publi@@ ci@@ zed the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , s@@ own potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood came to an end .
his childhood was over two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave behind organised crime in Mexico that inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ í@@ tico 2015 created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which it links , contain pictures on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a counter@@ f@@ eit .
but what is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist .
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
since its first release it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies actually taking place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tank truck tra@@ vers@@ ed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which covered dozens of houses including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to be unmistak@@ able .
one picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Multiple images of the incident form the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it features rows of char@@ red bodies str@@ ung on the floor while people look at it .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms , and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities before they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt by the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false post@@ ings ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning message published by the United Nations described those who could flee stro@@ kes , rape and several dead , some through burning .
while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts appeared like the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that fal@@ sely claimed that Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ an was being said , monks and politicians participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these dec@@ eit@@ ful dec@@ ou@@ sions range back to 2011 and 2012 and are indeed coming from all over the world .
with an &quot; reverse picture search , &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed .
an in@@ verse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are similar to the aforementioned image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed the wrong reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published . thus , we want to show the coverage more clearly than through the language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases also linked to each other ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases which can now be fully trac@@ ed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false couplings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting or fal@@ si@@ fications .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also demonstrate counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only names the ho@@ ax , but also disc@@ usses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) .
in this article about explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report contains the image ) .
France , 2015 .
after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; clearly no pages like Ho@@ ach@@ bu@@ ster have seen that dispro@@ ve this .

this article draws attention to the continuing distress of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar but cited the work of an article by the Indian Express with the image from the DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express did not contain this picture at the time of publication of our contribution .

this page used the picture as a proof that Muslims were killing Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact check page 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a group of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims through the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the image .
Italy , 2015 .
one inhabit@@ ant of the city district P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photograph from DR Congo was seen as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , with on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to legi@@ timi@@ ze the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
the Myanmar government published a right to judge what it ple@@ dged as &quot; deliberately fake news and photos that came to international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with respect to Myanmar . &quot;
this judge , which has been published exclusively in English , includes references to fake images of sm@@ ells , the H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; problems of eating re @-@ stretching ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news article fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and the image will continue to be included in this publication .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news repor@@ ter An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , published now , has expressly declared that the picture is not from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was later circul@@ ated in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertilizer &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , sleeping the world ) .
the image of the DR Congo , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted to achieve greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ yed ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the Embassy in which the image was contained in DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ in@@ mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos distant dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the map in Gra@@ y ) also indicate Tin@@ Eye but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which were only apparent after the original accident of 2010 , the picture might ultimately have a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that go through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence related to the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the kill@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and dimin@@ ishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which examined how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be solved in the context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ enfor@@ ce@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer linguistic inspir@@ ations a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
one word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you will find words from the English language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Be anxi@@ ous about your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other forms of thought and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite topics here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after a mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ c@@ ely hundreds of people were missed because of the floo@@ ding and slu@@ dge av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls ceased on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygienic conditions of the population are a massive challenge for the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the dimension of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 m . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et regularly update the flood situation .
many use h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the crisis of den@@ gue , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are ready to carry emergency deliveries to the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods to flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ ba .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ entre will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; key that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of emergency and provide support measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love girlfriend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the last minute we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we channel rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others channels par@@ ole against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things don &apos;t concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I &apos;m not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; who have built themselves up in their conception .
they reli@@ eved me .
there are 1,7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims do not fit in there , they must be de@@ vised .
become de@@ mus@@ ti@@ zed
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even happened to the poet , whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;@@ an and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting accounts for a large part of the story of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid crushed the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dis@@ rupt them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries during the last three decades , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings , Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this powerful Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movement for change .
it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion are
in the news industry , we are dealing more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims , in the highest degree , constitute the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America .
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ thought the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore Muslims and Americans .
but am I a Muslim and an American now ?
sometimes , when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes out or wearing my handy pocket @-@ pocket which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ forged Islam@@ ist machine series with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell her , there is hos@@ tility to more than just a stranger that tears the veil from a woman .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim when they could see through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual with my daughter in the evening , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab scriptures to protect the Kor@@ an and to be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .

affili@@ ation is the picture of my grand@@ mother with her sisters ; as they have been winning a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi decades ago .
it is the image of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi @-@ saints ; and a Kor@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers which she had told me to speak if I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - have been colon@@ ised by an empire , which a company founded with the name of Hon@@ orable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in the meantime , while writing books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan was sore v@@ ex@@ ed about his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in half a century .
affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot &apos;s bom@@ ber of history was dropped over a century ago over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ t@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim trunk of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ settled story .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered over every continent except Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
being an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy ha@@ stens the US and the susp@@ ects bear a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that a African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country two hundred years ago .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ junc@@ tions , but fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of the 1.7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing branch &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim regi@@ stra@@ y that began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists in the immigration official , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it exists in a country that exclu@@ des its borders from people from the countries that are bom@@ bing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ F@@ ly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we throw to Muslim lands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study called A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically sound picture and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to de@@ file a Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognise the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous im@@ prints that we get into our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ el@@ o Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increasingly Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IST , Muslim , American super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global time point in which we are .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts , who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; different . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet existed ; now they are ruling great areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who have made me a Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread crum@@ bs in my speech .
things that perhaps awaken memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity makes , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made to another .
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are taking place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural rac@@ ism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling it here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being w@@ aged and people through the creation of the &quot; other &quot; have been revealed in the public performance four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of soli@@ di@@ fying the &quot; other , &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president to give us chocolate cake while bom@@ bed already broken countries and &quot; to other man @-@ made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Ros@@ si , using license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honor the variety of languages of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
while &quot; listening is often associated with understanding &quot; these events are instead &quot; listening , to appreciate , feel , to make . &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers constitute their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and representation lead to the audience getting involved .
they cry out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells us the f@@ able of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
they have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organisers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story scre@@ enings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Puerto Rico calls for re@@ establishment of sovereign debt from the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the Francis@@ can Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old@@ town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens front for the re @-@ examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church council of Puerto Rico .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ establishing the debt also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are being held accoun@@ table for their corruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be reconc@@ iled with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside are threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for Light and Truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .
this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on the digital culture that is held in Berlin , dedicated an event to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a researcher in the France @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books published by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : collective Ref@@ l@@ ection Research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the true costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side @-@ by @-@ side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ m , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Coll@@ ective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up in this process from time to time ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown location .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on November 12 , 2015 , they had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ ordained &apos;s cultural prototypes were more man@@ a@@ geable than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
obviously , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other det@@ ain@@ ees as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ o@@ gue she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is devoted to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens during each visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace ,
that every danger doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guar@@ dians
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
whom I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and let me leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian network for human rights ( Syrian network for human rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we repeat our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : Director of Court sentenced to previous post due to corruption
Moz@@ ambi@@ que responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence at which the corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other def@@ end@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the de@@ mis@@ e of 54 million people ( about 800@@ ,000 euros ) .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose council held Cam@@ ba@@ za from 2005 to 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ election to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume its old post , as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many residents do not welcome the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary .
however , the company apparently remained silent and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; disgu@@ sting &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom he had served .
he could give paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is happy to be paid for his silence .
un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambi@@ can and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not say any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already heavily insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za is lacking mor@@ als and serving the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has only served on the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state to act as an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become we@@ ary of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewar@@ ding .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only remember the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is also criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he was 10 years old and was released .
and today the company in which he res@@ ig@@ ns money continues under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pav@@ is - Exclu@@ sive stub@@ ble stories ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network launched their posts from the network , because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for the purpose of its use have also been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ keeper A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ so :
a post of one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing at Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( age b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experience of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started del@@ eting his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his mail was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook is removed .
in the post , the author gave his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to l@@ essen rac@@ ism in Burma through their platform , but that &apos;s not how it works .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; her@@ edi@@ tary curr@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among the users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are making fun on Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech but were removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat a pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critic@@ ised for his failure to control the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than on code concentr@@ ating initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should ban this practice , so that the age @-@ ready age is now 18 .
in May 2016 Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing representatives of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not interfere as it is , old age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this occurred despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.@@ 1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical focal point confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to aboli@@ sh laws for the to@@ e of children followed at the foot and rejo@@ iced with great support . they doub@@ tless helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they should , dam@@ n , take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated case , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent living room , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where already a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the sen@@ ators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and not a single against it .
having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally amended .
Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk which disgu@@ ised the heart of the matter , but you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived :
public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been approved .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ey Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the prof@@ ess@@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now 18 years independent of religious affili@@ ation .
the draft for the change of the married network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the to@@ e is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... )
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , Secretary General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the country &apos;s best @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal steps , the law was to be passed away , and he seems to have made his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General , Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advoc@@ ate of the law , said that it is absolutely legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wants to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject elsewhere .
Patri@@ cia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if , instead of holding the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that only encourages panic and dis@@ grace , instead of talking about the problem that we , our daughters prevent it from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marri@@ ages are legal or the norm in various gra@@ dations , even though there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again .

for over a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV @-@ series defend themselves against the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy web users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia , as described recently in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. computer @-@ calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , however , irre@@ voc@@ able in spite of the legal prohibition .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the news ( via Wikipedia ) , we made it possible to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.@@ org itself .
IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a @-@ Foundation , and it is just about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edi@@ a Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ chu@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites , when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .

it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL that is not the original . that which you can see is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server forwards the request to the correct Wikipedia page , making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
for this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ ess r@@ hin@@ oc@@ eros , ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motives and washed colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and to try to strai@@ gh@@ ten out the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook , how this prime location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a phone call from my father that would be a le@@ op@@ ard on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to cr@@ ush pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood facing tig@@ ers before face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the baggage appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for &quot; ( lit . : I click on the protection of the environment ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see some of these photos below .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands for the first time
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband as a result of social pressure , and fear of the consequences should they ignore the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced by a pseu@@ do @-@ court from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer pen@@ alties to fear , if at all , they should not come back to this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club , thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
being one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and is committed to the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
for seven years , Roh@@ ini Pa@@ p has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HIV and AIDS , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambass@@ adors for change .
the first video showing Roh@@ ini in their discussion was of women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open up a discussion on the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands according to their hus@@ bands is a custom which they all hold out du@@ ti@@ fully and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life for him .
a woman who does not consider this is considered a dec@@ eit@@ ful thing , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who so far had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband ling@@ ered long after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked everyone , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ ained only in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by blasph@@ em@@ ing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of one of the participants was less understanding and the situation was in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zin@@ ced red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ ced red dot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang , talking about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example , like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ sa Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt across a tro@@ user ; they did not dare .
after a lot of discussion and discussion about the advantages of the own choice of clothing , morality linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled her own pair of Kur@@ dist@@ an ( upper shirts ) into a discussion , so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will manage it .
on the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms that things are moving slowly into roles :
so far , we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped referring to her husband &apos;s name .
some , including myself , do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like viol@@ ets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first visit to Japan by the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a memorial day
the Beat@@ les during her landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was the h@@ ash@@ tag to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed Beat@@ les 1964 in London , noticed in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here became clear quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka told , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan . more than 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English teaching at Japanese middle schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it belongs to fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places that are related to the band .
when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( Memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road .
we did the same last year too .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen @-@ no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to take place today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que target of attacks .
photo : different bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for deser@@ ted purposes , is disturbing the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi .
it gave the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group , the target of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN was carrying out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que gl@@ atz@@ headed men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the mos@@ que police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ um Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ mo@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably abnormal rituals has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a on Facebook shared the chron@@ icles of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ que , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country in which people would have shame to go to the street , attract female sex against good notes , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald are hun@@ ted for dis@@ fi@@ end purposes or &quot; black magic , &quot; which aim to achieve fast rich@@ ness .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ avi@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ ina , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald :

a pioneer of the Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ sel &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who claimed to be inside the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but they did not give any further information .
B@@ lah &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el works as a pioneer in the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have campaig@@ ned for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to die in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .

the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as &quot; an internal affair , &quot; and said a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .

Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union of European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the leading diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ us , as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with him that the American &quot; wants him to have the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth @-@ Pol@@ ley , announced on 27 June to the AF@@ P news agency that the Embassy would ask the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
the US Embassy &apos;s call came to a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can enter into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany , Germany and Switzerland
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hope that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian &quot; solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 Summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns whether the vor@@ tex for Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada through Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is Li@@ u not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to talk and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom to exercise those rights . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and surroundings
France &apos;s Foreign Office requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it .
Taiwan , Taiwan and Taiwan
the Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party also called on China to allow the ill @-@ intellectual li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned with Li@@ u on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore .
and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old Ly@@ re emerges from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be Democrats , leave the twisted logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given last week by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were really not answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial system , our political system .
he dealt with relevant questions in a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to express his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point , if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , An@@ on points out the critics that one should start reading the complete tran@@ script of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections .
he compared Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the US Justice Minister said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; faith@@ fully committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian loudspeaker ?
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is both land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore pay their military service , but they only defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine expands to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; etc . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices said recently to its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world being exposed and another fac@@ et is to be revealed .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , sorry , &quot; I will answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 .
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Ro@@ cky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook ou@@ tra@@ geous in anger if they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little difference between Can@@ adi@@ ans and Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag well visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ les to their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are cour@@ te@@ ous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first of all , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if you were confused with Johnny from Dallas , for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means to be phi@@ list@@ ine - just like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The S@@ imp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian double @-@ lon@@ er ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to push .
being harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not deserve attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of Can@@ adi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then stepped onto the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop @-@ band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the j@@ un@@ ta , which in 2014 took power and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , still go@@ vern the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man telling what regulations his girlfriend makes .
although not politically , the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even Charlie Chap@@ lin &apos;s video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as regards the situation of the country under the j@@ un@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army .
the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of &quot; change in settings &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded by the j@@ un@@ ta as a critic .
the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was also set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ utes people accused of having perpet@@ u@@ ated the monarchy .
Thailand employs a strict sent@@ encing of &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( maj@@ esty insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it became a coup of the army .
one of the problems faced by the j@@ un@@ ta is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that buying would be unnecessary and a waste of taxes .
the video even shows how people are thrown into a black van , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post@@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district .
more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ asi@@ an war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ am@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ pool of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
different ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on Soviet sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ h@@ are live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the entire population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after it had barely risen for over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this area .

the empty five @-@ floor blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ ch@@ kov@@ s , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were par@@ is@@ hi@@ on@@ ers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have meanwhile left the district .
about fifty residents live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ u@@ sche@@ ow@@ ka , which still accommodate one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to let ourselves be photograph@@ ed , &quot; says one of the girls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it &apos;s difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread for the villages in winter .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighbourhood ) , moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina does not have to leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia for ever , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she gives . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
Ant@@ aly@@ a &apos;s inter@@ loc@@ utor Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recently we bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child benefit for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was located , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation at first when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I remember every day the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation came to an end , a little boy ran over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children tra@@ cked now scre@@ aming the ball .
while they run , some of them throw stones on the fallen buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood that ensures authenticity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any differently .

it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the vesti@@ bu@@ le there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrived here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people are coming into full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept outside on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill , she bu@@ ys drugs that she can &apos;t pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa is an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao leaves with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children again .
they lived in Brazil but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he tells us that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has been guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ask him if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have received migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ in @-@ one , offered him its roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take .
back in the house of Mama Afrika , everything is full of guests .
in the ais@@ les , the travellers sil@@ ently consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
MS Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leav@@ ens her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many more travel@@ er more , boy and old .
she laugh@@ ed sadly , while she briefly presented her to me .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , for the use of the most advanced user environments .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a phone notification in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities were able to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had mess@@ ed up news with a private We@@ Chat group just after they had installed the app .
the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists together with illegal religious activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on @-@ line and remotely control their home network .
this app with min@@ ors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China tend to focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit disturbances and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , published in China , published the cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the inhabitants random@@ ly , whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be det@@ ained for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use equipment intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( in a so @-@ called &quot; spot@@ ting &quot; ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang regulations may have a response to the instructions of the city party council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all governmental branches , authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued an ordin@@ ance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the instruction to let all residents and entrepreneurs register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible violations , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; S@@ leep or Death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and discover that you are alone in a place where everything is important disappeared .
everything has gradually van@@ ished and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes honour to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when the reality gets back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls of your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
they arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
all districts sought , but not my own .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t set high demands on a town that has been stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ med down after the power supply stopped working in the neighborhood .
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , real friends joined me ; we united into a magnificent picture that filled my expectations with full satisfaction .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can return your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel of Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
the Col@@ onel of Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes fixed on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are sad to look at me and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest chat that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his father is the same with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed woman lies in my nose until today .
he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a mental torture that I had been subjected to months for months .
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I remember all the details exactly before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they have probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share them with only one other prisoner and I must immediately sit without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the civil servant left the cell and I laid back on an old @-@ tried communication method : beating the f@@ ist against the wall .
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; first prisoner . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was an emin@@ ent middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in the perfect darkness , there are no striking tra@@ its on me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like me ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was reloc@@ ated to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would let him go if I remain .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s that refresh at the fruit in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es rang every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure des Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ it@@ ors and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tian dial@@ ect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al hei@@ ress card and betra@@ yed the close look of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he does so .
he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that gli@@ de him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ver and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to respond .
I really can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had not done anything to make this penalty .
on penalty in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cri@@ es .
my cri@@ es were not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the magnificent invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er saw the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why it picked up next to an electrically charged wand .
electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed which occurred to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am answering the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be silent and go away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he stro@@ lls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives on the top floor of his family house , which has been theirs since 1967 ; the year when Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( like : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , opposing the conservative majority and ques@@ tioning its well @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
at the age of 25 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ize with people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation . &quot; he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b stresses .
then he adds : &quot; I think , because I am a man , &quot; while he po@@ urs in water @-@ dissolved N@@ es@@ café into two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset .
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
apparently H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking down with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam in a hot j@@ unk day .
basically , the slu@@ dge speaks warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose princip@@ ally of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially when you look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the general public during Ram@@ adan water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry , Jord@@ ani@@ ens , has already cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation .
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was cancelled &quot; straight &quot; because of the sex@@ iness of the singer .
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activity , which raises the well @-@ established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; which continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement might well not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect a reality that is increasingly evident in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ treated traditional gender norms to Lei@@ be by dra@@ fting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had a pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently de@@ formed uni@@ denti@@ fied woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust .
in recent years , the number of &apos; hon@@ our@@ able mor@@ des &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official out@@ war@@ dly left .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ours reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is even more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to the 1954 bre@@ aching law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure , as well as the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known to not shy away from any issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit all@@ u@@ sions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and freedom of expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politics have been told me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in essence can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats itself often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where , in his words , &quot; that can get what you want &quot; - whether it &apos;s faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored by 2014 .
in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya to later point out that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and his opinion had been cens@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube , it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires openly for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not consistent with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poetry .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert has been cancelled .
in the realm of the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adher@@ ed to several former members of the government and members of the teaching association with the reason that they have cri@@ tically expressed themselves on comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country &apos;s deep @-@ rooted corruption .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is , according to opinion , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally @-@ led demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue ra@@ cking and , consequently , resist .

Nab@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ ula festival .
one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the for@@ ts , drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time in which armies from west Japan have mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the emis@@ hi , to their knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
you can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
for a long time I look forward to the Meg@@ uro @-@ Ga@@ jo@@ en : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of an 18 metre high solid was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

external appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this history , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession such as the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the fancy hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks of them , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive a training in the hair@@ dressing art instead of bad ratings , which enables them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 we were the only school in the commun@@ e and the district , which we are very proud of , because we built this educational community out of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
used with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the &quot; love message to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
this article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled ?
this is precisely the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Stiftung Bo@@ got@@ Art and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ li@@ aci@@ ón ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as .
recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government closed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
but before the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and had their weapons around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , now has to take them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the campaign aims to receive 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly talk to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but those who need them more need@@ less .
he also told us to share his love with people that needed most of the most pressing attention this year .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally .
the F@@ ARC members stood up as they used to take the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go , because next to him on the bed there was a m@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has never written something like that in my life , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I embra@@ ced him completely and sat down beside the gar@@ net .
perhaps he was sorry for the war , he felt sorry to be the loyal companion of this comb@@ at@@ ant all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never had expected anything else from life as a war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now that peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
for the start , students and some of the leaders of the F@@ ARC gathered for a discussion .
the students were all grown up when war prevailed and the F@@ ARC was already in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC explained the history of the organization , its ide@@ als , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state took effect on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote , and recogni@@ zing that the people whom I often saw as monsters and even had learned to hate , even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all humans - including those who killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter for example Dar@@ ía de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bian was proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but that is not the case .
as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities exist , there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now focusing on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terror activists have witnessed the reporting of recent months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat posed like Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert over the local LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community did not come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya took over the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports were published which addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ ash@@ ina in the Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ained suspi@@ cious men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equ@@ ation of their rural wife , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina .
for fear of her life she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a con@@ cu@@ bine who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following news : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remedy this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App did the round .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to fetch some shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
then I heard another phrase , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long do you still honor the family , you Sch@@ and@@ el@@ eck ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , no 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again .
apparently some women had got everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , my male name is still on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very thank@@ ful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect .
I spent more than one month in hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that it was all a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said I must prove it by running up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad speech and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people spoke to my mother once on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was too much to my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car under the window with dark windows and a number sign with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without registering without notice , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you do not believe , you would be safe , only because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I really try to look at how the person looks at which she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who had settled in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives .
I mean , they probably invite relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there is not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives , in order to judge himself as a Ca@@ det &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base .
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply gone , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person himself was there when these people were taken with them .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but so far there have been no reports . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in Ernst &apos;s case !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ bular je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never made me a hair .
in front of the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met .
it was a small place where several banks were standing , and the whole city knew of it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language , there is a saying : K@@ har@@ sh@@ ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long has this time of grace held ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality in television .
he did not talk about us per se , but rather about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , you could feel how people began to change in the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he who had smil@@ ed and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you once with suspicion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deterior@@ ated .
OC Media : which activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets .
I don &apos;t have a p@@ enny for it for a long time .
I discovered these people themselves when I cli@@ cked away places of refuge .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same thing as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys in them .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ es have which , the cab@@ ar@@ ins have which , the Russians also have ; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know many think of transi@@ ent to men who love men , and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling , to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me , it &apos;s the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;ll be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .

local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ v@@ ts@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate among the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .

the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 re @-@ faced the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his hel@@ pl@@ essness , his inability to stand up for his family , according to Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ ra@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab An@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family fathers who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it hard for the native Arab population to cont@@ end its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ ra@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a large variety of tr@@ unks that re@@ direct water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k you@@ ths has now risen to 81 % . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed a secondary school of 55 % and have completed a university degree of 45 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ zi , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ tend to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and for@@ cing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ah@@ ra@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing .
given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activ@@ ist alert the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ist not &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can be read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - respond with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , despite the same education , women nowadays still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later , and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old under it .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on rac@@ ism , black C@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used by ra@@ cial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to keep silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they don &apos;t want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men to have the same rights at all ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind , which refer to both sex and skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an app@@ alling and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimil@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin colour and sex . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to completely rid myself of femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for ourselves .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and margin@@ alization after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled over the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special request by the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; said Mus@@ a .
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers , bro@@ o@@ ks and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was filmed and filmed for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , spar@@ se sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed congregations , who can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by C@@ elle . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ lt ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected people .
a police commission@@ er , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of her relationship some time has passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman presented Bal@@ bu@@ ena on account of abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also took advantage of the accurate display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her display .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women complain at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women , who admit , be victims of violence , report to the prosecution authorities at all .
content 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a Legal System that does not subject No@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good Appro@@ ach , inadequate Implem@@ entation Stri@@ kes and Statistics
My@@ rr@@ Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ ón y E@@ studios , a social science research institute in Paraguay says , &quot; There are different statements and reports , but they do not even point to the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General presented 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts . here , too , 86 % of women &apos;s ads came .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on every woman who has been ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this come to every woman who has been charged with physical abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s hom@@ icide in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the co @-@ ordin@@ ator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the name of all her former friends .
at first she didn &apos;t want that , but then she gave up . that should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognis@@ able :
I never thought that I would once be victim of abuse .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive , because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook , describing his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity to blame .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated .
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that is made up of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ an &apos;s case , everything began with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria &apos;s ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ay@@ an laws : good approach , inadequate implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Women &apos;s Organization in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # für@@ sten@@ dam@@ m ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non@@ entity ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original bill of the law fores@@ ees to explain and punish fem@@ inists for a perpet@@ ual crime , as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to win the MEPs for the law , which feared that it would pa@@ ve the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years in prison .
the original bill had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear in the present time , if they simply want to submit a complaint and wish to receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
a re@@ think must take place here , so that violence is no longer seen as something normal .
whoever remains silent in the face of these facts makes him guilty and contributes to the perpet@@ rators of offen@@ ders .
we have to reimbur@@ se for such a long time until mal@@ treatment is no longer considered normal .
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed before , among other things , a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions on the changes will go apart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reconciliation section has been seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cancellation of the words &quot; sex , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman still subject to attacks a year after a newspaper bann@@ ing
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Catalan authorities closed the independent Arabic language Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served as a prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i were arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sult@@ an Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having aboli@@ shed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , the main offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sult@@ an &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic trade secret , the public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and in@@ sti@@ g@@ ating .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 , it was reported about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , noticed that an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were charged with pressur@@ ing Ju@@ dge of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a verdict in a case dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon arrival .
on August 9 , 2016 , ISS retained the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief at Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the paper is prohibited on any means , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at .
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of viol@@ ating a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ania Ri@@ al ( US $ 7@@ 800 ) . in addition , a year@@ ling ban against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a security deposit of 5000 om@@ ega ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after losing his 6 @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ k@@ at . al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari is still in prison , where he served as a prison sentence .
the App@@ eals Chamber also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Intelligence to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Catalan government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; for three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information , personally signed another order in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three additional months , with which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of App@@ eal to allow publication of the newspaper .
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman in recent times .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper , to cease operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j ;
2. to create a secure environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and neighbouring states by promoting freedom of expression and association , as well as the right to gather , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully .

Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , figure takes place with his approval
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : for one thing there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more grave consequences in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists helps to build up its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the continent &apos;s economic growth .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the central laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , especially when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus , before deciding to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : right now the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GM : what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a cre@@ ators .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because the financing and the opportunities for development are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you haven &apos;t had before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how large do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for specific scientific training , beginning at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research into space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
the system means that magazines are only accessible against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research .
from the US to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding .
the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on varieties . based on this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a millen@@ ary old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding Sal@@ ad , but meanwhile it takes longer , since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if a b@@ oul@@ der in a river is lying around which I have to jump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far for salads .
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new kind of salad , because all the features are patented . &quot; he continues to do as much as possible and try to breed the characteristics that he wants .
in doing so , however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and throughout the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman sal@@ at of the Out@@ side Gor@@ geous in the &quot; Green@@ house &quot; of the station . it tests whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name rather sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant bree@@ ders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i in short , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed them in order to breed their own varieties and not to immediately choose them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger groups such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by cultiv@@ ating seed with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg points out that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , he says and takes on the ever @-@ increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , whose recent examples are the mer@@ ging of food products , such as farmers markets , should also know that the way in which this vegetables are grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to keep their seeds freely available to others . in contrast , their approach is in contrast to pat@@ enting seed and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , because the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the growing intellectual property rights of plant material , which is therefore always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bree@@ ders either at all or only ag@@ grav@@ ated .
for other plants , such estimates do not exist yet , but experts like Lu@@ by assume that massive cultivated plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown so that they have specific desired characteristics - from those , through which their taste or color improves through to such , because of which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and endure threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse for@@ se@@ eable due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
it does , however , contradic@@ t the view that intellectual property has other bree@@ ders as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties foster innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
thus , such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it in a different way : to wait for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if one has to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost .
but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want to make agriculture easier for farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ ther@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as bree@@ ders we finally have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for whose cultivation methods produce her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds the concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is gent@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets but are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents , they create most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for salads in his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mor@@ ton .
Mor@@ ton is also the opinion that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties within a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , one is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties , the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
the German organization Agre@@ col works on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for bree@@ ders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding are different from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference entitled &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , non @-@ governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents on seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled for next year .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context in which Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how it is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this process , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of the C@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the Internet .
this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government locked up the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) website , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true despite this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ering of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who were supposed to defend the law and to give a voice to victims in this part of the world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 web@@ pages more than two months ago , for example the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era from Qatar because of alleged &quot; support for terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ aja used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles , which he writes for web pages and media not accessible in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with which Zi@@ aja &apos;s blog is also located , is on the other hand accessible .
Zi@@ aja , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ va commented on the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gging blog is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be significant to the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , an invitation to the national Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other web page for which I was working .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , which was possible by b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block@@ age of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice points to the intent of the government to continue blocking and filtering contents to which Egyptian users might have access .
in addition , the situation is wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these acts .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Jan@@ eiro in war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day , newspapers in Brazil report a glo@@ omy head@@ line from Rio de Jan@@ eiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Jan@@ eiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves ro@@ bs pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air tea to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio 2016 .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio on August 16 published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports of violence in the city will be published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . all that differs from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war crus@@ ade in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , there are 8@@ 43 domains controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in their opinion , a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accoun@@ t@@ ability to the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - combined with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ f@@ itable negl@@ ect of public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro is bigger than just its capital .

calling Rio de Jan@@ eiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data available .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ats per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is an extra member of the Global South American company , the largest media company in South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
one of these security policy measures was the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying massive police orders and permanently station@@ ing one unit there .
initially , this led to a decline of violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP has been bombar@@ ded by har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux of one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Con@@ ventions for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also pul@@ ls serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
one week ago , the police freed up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident struck head@@ lines too : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations , and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these zones controlled by rebels have been under siege outside of Damascus , causing residents to be reli@@ ant on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional food like meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how to plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ essi@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French News Agency AF@@ P : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is becoming more and more popular . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of planting fung@@ i , Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of the expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced plastic fuels are used to provide the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began producing fung@@ al seed coming from regions &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a bigger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coff@@ e@@ as@@ ure , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in areas of crisis and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the week before in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government called for a state dispute the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days .
fires were also recorded in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 fat@@ alities and more than 200 injured by fires .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , in Portugal alone , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into the happ@@ enings :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the target of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to reduce the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open streets surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building appro@@ vals in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , spread more and more according to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Portugal Civil Defence on October 15 and 16 , when residents were looking for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it used to use the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not hold the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million requests .

the way from Afghanistan to a successful entrepren@@ eur

in one night in the fall of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan turned into a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t tell it then she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy should break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af again found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was difficult and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his low wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ ding rec@@ alled in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabit@@ ated Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ ehol@@ es came to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary persons twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high number quot@@ as , but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are disa@@ strous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; human rights organisation writes the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the majority of asylum seek@@ ers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised institutions in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
according to Italian law asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
so it was also called A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unt@@ amed li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af inserted his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind ven@@ eti@@ an luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxation and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years a number of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Oriental Experience restaurant in which the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant nar@@ rates the history of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim to return to the country he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know my people suffer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af also forged plans for opening a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey of uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ eti@@ zen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail .
he reported on the clearance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the release of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .
photo taken by @ C@@ il@@ un@@ a@@ 27 on Twitter .
global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament checks a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks , register within six months after successful law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and identification number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or a criminal off@@ ence .
the Act , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal in which harder pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official would be introduced .
under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the President and government institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian police officers demonstrating against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting four years in jail for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , apparent burden of others arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the charges of the journalists , Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa , and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
listening to Tunisi@@ an activists to en@@ forced documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours listening to Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who was co @-@ founder of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s independent media platform and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated to an action plan that had been le@@ vi@@ ed . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , according to the plan , was explicitly backed by a controversial law bill , which was accused by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided all funds returned un@@ law@@ fully .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website poses a light on how the presidential agenda looks like to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention his sources , stating Articles 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which journalists safegu@@ arding the right to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he appeared as a witness in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May .
does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID ?
according to new regulations of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media .
in the regulations it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks . it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only sel@@ ectively asser@@ t these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat ? &quot;
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information &quot; in the state government .
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government lists a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and for@@ cing them upon request for the issu@@ ance of user data .
these websites are currently websites such as V@@ Cont@@ acts and Od@@ no@@ classi@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ ed Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ruled Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it became &quot; an information source that co@@ operates with groups to intensi@@ fy a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , next to , China , one of the few countries around the world , in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing around
after this week &apos;s le@@ aked documents , the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install tam@@ per@@ ing programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation runs until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
