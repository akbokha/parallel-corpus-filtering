<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I also grew up with American movies, have danced to American music, read American authors and operated their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, revealed the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "free to Method Man," "" "" "" "I was as if this was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very sentimental love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless people have reacted to his statements and tuned in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won with the republican pre-elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and its voters to the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which assimilates people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps also agreed not to agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I had met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still suits the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, their wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love toward America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump took his way to the nominee Republican candidate, they offered me a hold and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presidency gave a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">Categorising people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and intimates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters, most of whom are white have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to exalt a man looking down with contempt for those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (e. g. Ü): as much as "leaning against all other ethnic groups"; pun from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the big van Jones called, has just killed what America has done so splendidly.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - which belief or background one may have, America is welcome everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country elected as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, a huge part of the White American promises this promise and says: hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole notion of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">For all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who died in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your america?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your america? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "someone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "" "" "he received a coherent and loud" NO "" "" "" ""! "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaean town of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of the children but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For a number of years now La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the poverty that surrounds them.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico is known for its abuse of drugs and banal violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered his youth a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they get out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always arrive laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village that is practically on the top of the biggest landfill of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials are made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the Recycler, under the direction of Favio Chávez, has begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violin, viola, cellos, contrabass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of the trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguaya and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place where the parents worked in the litter The children didn't know any music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a trash produced violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of reprocessed material, called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic landfill) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates approximately one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and of him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Land fill harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even performed its music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can effectively fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats illegal illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practical environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the joint use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated in the Liberian waters of illegal fishing before it searched for the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law-breaker of this kind at their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles soon mobilized against the ship. they refused to baptise one of their ports and refused to give it a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries you simply refused everything," "" "" "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority," "" "" "" "is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of the plundering of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, established in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that the prime minister had expelled from their waters at that time.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together." "" "" "" "they exchange information and stand each other where illegal fishing goes" "" "" "", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Fund Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support to FISH-i." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to detect. in this way, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">The deliberate disregard of existing laws through which certain habitats and species are to be protected can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with which information circulated between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, for example, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i is also very attentive to the activities of ships when they move on the open seas via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to designate ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship is loading their caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the ships involved have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a criminal record.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing may refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay taxes, as in the case of prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that is what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting company supporting the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain an estimated $20 million of lost sales, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year because of illegal fishermen entering Eastern African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which attracts the region's commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specification of fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," says Long. "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could say" You must not run my port. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licences in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "" "" "says Bergh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"the illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross," says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support.</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organization: a platform that provides satellite data and can be displayed worldwide using the position of each tractable ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "gathering with neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "" "" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There is evidence that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also scaring them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be confiscated without licence and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile increased a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia, the inspectors were there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="147">"" "" "" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "" "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "" "" "we have become an object of study." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting the illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "safety is the aim of even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," Copeland says.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's latest member state Somalia was able to report its first great triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship travelling under a false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without licence and were used drag networks which are now prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="153">Road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They act as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empty space by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the currency translation of Venezuela), both demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the centre-north of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation is worsening continuously, which manifests itself in the everyday life of Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicines.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition have seen the opportunity for fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro; but ultimately, the holding of a new election has been blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the Government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% relative to the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum on impeachment for many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or short MUD (for example: round Table of the Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, urged the demonstrators to stand in the way against President Nicolás Maduro. "in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government seat, should continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">So far Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strife and on November 3 all go to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="170">The first demonstration during the action programme "The reconquest of Venezuela" took place on Wednesday, October 26.</seg>
<seg id="171">The pictures of the marches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in many areas of the country, but also confrontations with policemen and supporters of the government.</seg>
<seg id="172">One of the most frequently shared images shows a demonstrator who calls through the shields: "will you kill me because I am hungry?"</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter, images that tell of confrontations, as well as reports of oppression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Particularly large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators moved to the local cathedral to protect themselves against the police and armed advocates of the government according to his own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, several demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State Táchira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in Táchira do not wear coats, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardists do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic is already making the round, which maps the amount of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a tendering procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">The marches are increasing in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview from Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">Now in the context of the large La Perla Ribera process in the province of Córdoba, Quijano said against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, examined crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy Commander of the Secret Services Division of 141 in prison La Perla.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who was charged with abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">They called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>

<seg id="221">Just make sure they don't take you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo, a revolutionary People's Army, the military arm of the Argentinian revolutionary workers "party.</seg>

<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to crush the papers which had belonged to the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance of the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to get out. he led me to a barracks in which cars, furniture, TV, fridges - were simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything from it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were turned off and signed me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I pewed in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom bonded a person with handcuffs to the bed, overflowing him with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrible... like a dirty wound.</seg>
<seg id="244">Years later when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came from his room.</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with the translation mistake at a center in Kyoto, where you can extend your driving licence.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend their driving licence, were witnessing a particularly miserable translation in the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word was written on a shield (koraksha's sha), which means "older motorists," falsely - but perhaps also with evil ulterior motives & # 8212; as "awful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read from 1st to 20th September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edit the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been shared in many social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which appears in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "" "" "this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "" "" "said Holmes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The bad English translation was first removed. the name "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the appropriate, even though grammatically not quite correct "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture apologized for the translation mistake. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text she received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the apology as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we sincerely regret that elderly people felt insulted by the inadequate correction (translation) on our part," said the police. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of elderly drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers, who are involved in accidents across the country, is quite a reason to worry.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of 19.460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, Senior citizens caused 1,803 of a total of 11.850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has fallen in total, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the version of the article published on Yahoo, the named Reporter published comments on the light showing the prejudices that some Japanese apparently howl against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on Yahoo with the translation error has among other things the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "" "" "-" "" "" "" "Is this (" awful car "" "" "" "") about reality? "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>

<seg id="373">Translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia.</seg>
<seg id="374">The Engrish.com website is a real treasure trove for these bizarre errors in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo by Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">There are many reasons for the widespread dissemination of translation errors.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could make translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that even have no foreign employees let translations be done in-house. then the Japanese employee, whose English language is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic propositions which arise through machine translation show that this technique can not yet be replaced by a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or governments that have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">Hopefully the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more reputable source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: taking the protests and censorship measures on the internet and on television</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navajo con Libertad" portal (free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users announced that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried photographs of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April after the Supreme Court dissolved Parliament and delegated the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the link was cropped and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: enables your VPN to be activated.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites are again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Telecommunications Commission threatened them with fines and closures when they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinintro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier investigations of the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique whereby the DNS servers respond to requests for certain domains.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds unfailingly or denies the request when making such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm your DNS-lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the broadcast was stopped on Thursday 6th April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who survived the protests in Caracas live, was detained.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released and VPITV went on air again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, the government has also reported that the government regulates internet connections, making it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay, many girls become slaves to receive education</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was as a child a Criadita. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for children's rights and collects testimonies of other Criadis who have been victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. using the kind permission of the turban.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report from the general public, published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen" ("Flying cows, falling schools") edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family living there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "" "" "she said," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began to work as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay, she referred to the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned here is that the children have to pay countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be paid - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke to Criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criadita, generally guarantees silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">There is, on the one hand, the family, whose daughter is in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is abused, his family will learn about it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016 the so far unknown phenomenon occurred, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of strong strokes. shortly after she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military officer Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira was hit with a stick on Marín until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela denounced the practice of the Criadazgo deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered than children," says Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to trial, the case of Carolina Marín may be pointing the way - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to trial.</seg>
<seg id="454">The daily life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criadians are exploited not only as labour, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to log in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In her employer's house Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The sooner she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because it had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as a meal from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party that was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the host Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read the editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">In doing so, he tried to convince them not to believe the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the host had found someone to listen while talking about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would" learn bad habits "there again." this meant that Alvarenga, who belonged to the indigenous group of Guaraní, would again speak their mother tongue Guaraní back home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was, however, completely clear that she paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">In school, too, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "a thing that is almost never spoken about are bullying and the chicanes who are exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to go home. I had no friends in the school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not a group.</seg>
<seg id="479">The isolation was the worst of all, "explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="480">Society approves the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="494">The business was complete.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the prolog to the report Criadita, ¿hasta cuándo?</seg>
<seg id="496">(Criadita, as long ago?), a collection of testimonies former Criadita, writes Ortiz:</seg>
<seg id="497">In the course of our history, we managed to abolish systems such as slavery, Cuñadazgo (a practice from the early history of Paraguay, while the Spanish Conquistadores, the Conquistadores, the women of Guaraní) and the indigenous population (with whom the workers as half-slaves) had to pay tribute to them) and the system of the Mensú (where the workers as semi-slaves) went into a system of slavery, in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="502">"" "" "" "sixty-six Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on" "" "" "" "regulations regarding the use and benefits of social networks" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="503">When it is adopted by the Parliament, users of social media must register with a government agency in Egypt to use social media including Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="504">On the basis of the law, a place would then be set up to allow citizens to use social media.</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their correct names and ID numbers to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If this fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fine.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video surveillance and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattler, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of Telecommunications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook. "</seg>

<seg id="524">This article by Todd Reubold was published in the original on Ensia.com, a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions.</seg>
<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the Tierschuterin Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards, who roam through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). in total, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat as they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular species of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza appears in the video, "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a large predator is present.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera hall, Raza bounces out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza likes to show another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, she has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to establishing protected areas for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper in Japan, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the disaster.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was an etectable prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring fectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had left entire coastal towns disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture still had a nuclear accident, which alone had to leave their homes for 160,000 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction site in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacements were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to see the greatest success among the three prefectures, and 80 percent of the planned replacements were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the disaster, evacuated dwellings were evacuated (to put casetsu uutaku) into final replacement parts.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the threefold disaster nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima were still living in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who lived after the disaster in shelters, were moved to final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three prefects concerned</seg>
<seg id="560">As the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has been able to determine, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by misfortune have reopened its doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have suffered tremendously in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far removed.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to ascertain a complete picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local people and among the evacuees. it asked them about the state of reconstruction and also how their sense of feeling had changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey carried out that 83.1 percent of local residents took action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed believe that there is still insufficient evidence of disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to be evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuation from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, were resettled to permanent replacements.</seg>
<seg id="580">More than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture are still living in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas, most of the evacuation centres are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects which are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater than the common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important because they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind ourselves that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">As a result of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak to five Global Voices members, remembering a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egheri explains how the love of music overcame the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she has collected with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widespread photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had him beaten up against his head during a demonstration in Goiana. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the Federal University Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is regarded as critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a headstock. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás noted that Sampaio was suspended until the investigation of the incident was suspended from the active service.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Goiana with his headstock on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed in the intensive care unit, his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media channel of media activists from Goiana, shared the video taken by Luiz da Luz on the net in which one sees how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics hurry to him shortly.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus who lives in another state, Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Reais (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Goiana while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás experiences a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp-group joined a gas leak. and now we have the very sad case of Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who is on the intensive care station after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a headstock.</seg>

<seg id="616">Police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators built a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The member of Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers in the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Once again, the Brazilian media has toured street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagonist: a window disc.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo were reporting a broken glass window in order to visualize their title pages illustratively with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">On the other hand, O Globo preferred a cover story with a fire-set bus.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window disc than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly opposed to any form of property damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too, the term "vandalism" gets an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by headlines called "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>
<seg id="625">Villages forgotten by the de-industralization in Cuba</seg>
<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba shut the doors (Photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding the fact that there is no notable harvest of sugar on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After exhaustion, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long period of inactive time are in operation because they were received.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane plant would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the municipality saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">Between 2017 and 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must be between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If present production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this day will certainly go into history" "" "" "", "these were the first words of the Cuban president Fidel Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane plant Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Perez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he's most repeated is "fraud."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of the Jubilee, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially recorded documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the defunct factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane producers, which had yet been in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is awaiting the retirement in another facility that Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the decommissioning of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youngsters of First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it by means of Hip-Hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have direct mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in North-Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree hip-hop group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop concludes that the young participants in discussions discuss topics such as "cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school "Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumeb First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway der tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen usually indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unenlightened.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important is the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs were published in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youth involved here got some help from Gary Jolly from Northstar Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a verse in Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because we as youth have lost our way in life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day.</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also go ahead of our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they have done to the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse to Silverbank (which is also published on his blog and republished here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (to be used), "plastic models of dishes" are issued by any food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is an entire industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are a large number of small companies that produce precisely those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them any more. however, a new trend nowadays turns them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger featured a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile handbands decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few shockup fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an awning-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phones and mobile phones allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or Lachswort is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "" "" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with salmon swindling?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also assume a less appetizing form in order to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortably.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handystrips of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes you can watch yourself at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag # to be used to do a range of hard-to-do.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you'd like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the Missing and Getting went out on a regular basis only in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely repressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind each body, behind each bone bust stands in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which is supposed to give these victims a voice and tell stories about people who were in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug traffickers and whole communities have to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video titled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "changing the life of fear") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephews on just a single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "" "" "priests:" "" "" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, for the people we loved." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical store in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">On October 15th he should be back, but he never came back. "Emma Veleta:" it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="769">There is also my mother, who is here with me too.</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You are insuring my father's insurance, but she does not pay them out because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get them? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories from readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for a number of years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who resists or is sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug trafficker) when he is big. and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the "feats" of the perpetrators when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being "rebellious."</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the post of "Four months extortion in the Capital District: how a family was plundered with threats." it describes how armed criminals were squeezing money out of their business month by month until they were destroyed not only in the business but also torn apart their families.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain never passes away, the trauma remains, fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will deceive you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I wondered if weeping would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "" "" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega publicized the contribution" "" "" "" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by the organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow in a settlement at the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, sown potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, violence by organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office counted 3103 killings. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave behind organised crime in Mexico that invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we cannot forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," animal Político 2015 created the data journalism project Narcodata whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rumor or exposing a counterfeit.</seg>
<seg id="819">But what is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it has been misleading to portray tragedies actually taking place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of image and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images on news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank truck traversed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths full of potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which covered dozens of houses including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to be unmistakable.</seg>
<seg id="831">One picture entitled "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Multiple images of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It features rows of charred bodies strung on the floor while people look at it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities before they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "" "" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "" "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "" "" "said a resident of Human Rights Watch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images, the follow-up time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerias and the attempt by the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo again, as it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false postings; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely relate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning message published by the United Nations described those who could flee strokes, rape and several dead, some through burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, posts appeared like the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page that falsely claimed that Myanmar's Than was being said, monks and politicians participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations called AFP as their source also falsely attributed Thein to this statement, but had not associated the image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="859">The global reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these deceitful decousions range back to 2011 and 2012 and are indeed coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">With an "reverse picture search," you can see how far information can be crossed.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverse picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures under 18.8 billion pictures (as of 3 May 2017), which are similar to the aforementioned image from the DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mixed mash of private pages, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed the wrong reports, some have tried to expose falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have bordered examples of abusive use and linked them to the respective countries on the basis of which side they had been published. thus, we want to show the coverage more clearly than through the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the countries listed below (which in some cases also linked to each other), several examples may be used for misuse.</seg>

<seg id="901">Malaysia, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="902">Malaysia offers two extreme examples of abusive use of the image from DR Congo, with on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nigerian massacre, and on the other hand the attempt of a blogger to legitimize the assertions that Rohingya are being prosecuted, since the photos were used improperly.</seg>
<seg id="903">Myanmar, 2017.</seg>
<seg id="904">The Myanmar government published a right to judge what it pledged as "deliberately fake news and photos that came to international media, international human rights organisations and governments, in an attempt to create misunderstandings with respect to Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="905">This judge, which has been published exclusively in English, includes references to fake images of smells, the Hate Speech and used by extremist groups to show that Muslims kill Buddhists and vice versa (which is often propagated by Burmese nationalists).</seg>
<seg id="906">Russia, 2012. "problems of eating re-stretching?" (Christianophobia or political provocation?).</seg>
<seg id="907">This post, directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community, clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians.</seg>
<seg id="908">Saudi Arabia, 2012 / 2014.</seg>
<seg id="909">This news article falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar Than agreed in 2012 that monks and politicians participated in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and the image will continue to be included in this publication.</seg>
<seg id="911">Spain, 2015 / 2016.</seg>
<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the Boko Haram, published by the news reporter Análisis Digital, published now, has expressly declared that the picture is not from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>
<seg id="913">When the picture was later circulated in connection with the massacre of the Boko Haram in 2015, the newspaper El Pais tried to refute that there were links to Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorfertilizer" (Nigeria is burning, sleeping the world).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo, provided with this Twitterhashtag, triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of the Boko Haram in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted to achieve greater attention to these events, which took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times retweyed), but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Vietnamese), 2014.</seg>
<seg id="921">After a message that was allegedly written by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it a hoax.</seg>
<seg id="922">From the Embassy in which the image was contained in DR Congo, the organization of the Claretinmissionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distant distanced themselves.</seg>
<seg id="923">There are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="924">Other accounts, aggregators and pages in the following countries (on the map in Gray) also indicate TinEye but are no longer fully traceable: Czech Republic, Australia, India, Peru, Netherlands, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Azerbaijan, Japan and possibly China.</seg>
<seg id="925">(data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Webcrawler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Rohingya Muslims.)</seg>
<seg id="926">In all these cases, which were only apparent after the original accident of 2010, the picture might ultimately have a correct description, but the original fee is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that go through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence related to the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the killings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and diminishes the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study which examined how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be solved in the context or in a completely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons used according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unenforceable) strives to offer linguistic inspirations a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not at all to be translated.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudades) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobotesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or expression is not enough, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you will find words from the English language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Be anxious about your parents in recognition of how they have strived for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other forms of thought and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "invaluable" words, showing how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After a memorandum of the catastrophes centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and scarcely hundreds of people were missed because of the flooding and sludge avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and approximately 100,000 people have been transported to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls ceased on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygienic conditions of the population are a massive challenge for the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos give an impression of the dimension of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Flood in Tawalama town with water levels of up to 7.5 m. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet regularly update the flood situation.</seg>
<seg id="978">Many use hashtag # FloodSL to monitor the extent of the disaster.</seg>

<seg id="980">This morning the Neluwa bus stood in high water, water level up to 6 meters. village of Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the water pegels of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and further five are ready to carry emergency deliveries to the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>
<seg id="983">Facebook pages such as Help Flood Victims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Disaster Relief - Information Desk- Sri Lanka deliver important information on flood and humanitarian aid.</seg>

<seg id="987">Please call today the number 0777449729 or 0777843841 if you need help in this area.</seg>
<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app, so that the Katastophacentre will be informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the tropical storm of Roanu, PickMe introduced a "flood aid" key that allowed users to call a vehicle for pick-up assistance and donations. these were then sent to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also introduced a "SOS" key which resulted in more than a thousand inquiries and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people included in floods and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, where several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need of emergency and provide support measures.</seg>
<seg id="992">This has prevented the loss of further human lives, while the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of normality.</seg>

<seg id="1131">Why am I telling it here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars are being waged and people through the creation of the "other" have been revealed in the public performance four decades ago, even scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of solidifying the "other," as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we have no president to give us chocolate cake while bombed already broken countries and "to other man-made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices recently reported on another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and honor the variety of languages of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">While "listening is often associated with understanding" these events are instead "listening, to appreciate, feel, to make."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers constitute their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation lead to the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They cry out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells us the fable of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara asks: "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" with a broad grin he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">Until now, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organisers hope to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story screenings.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the Franciscan Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the oldtown of San Juans.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartouil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">This year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is held in Berlin, dedicated an event to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a researcher in the France-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books published by so-called 'Book Sprints' within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: collective Reflection Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here license-free, contains a series of articles dealing with the free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built up and what are the true costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side-by-side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartoum, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Memory gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What did we give up in this process from time to time?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel from Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown location.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police Bassel had taken part in a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on November 12, 2015, they had been contacted by people who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basordained's cultural prototypes were more manageable than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influence.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Obviously, Bassel could not finish this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other detainees as they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a proogue she wrote to her husband between 2012 and 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She muggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1254">Mozambique: Director of Court sentenced to previous post due to corruption</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique responded with anger to a corruption case in which a member of the government returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence at which the corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for the demise of 54 million people (about 800,000 euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose council held Cambaza from 2005 to 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his re-election to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume its old post, as the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many residents do not welcome the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a regression with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "" "" "CIP." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary action against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently remained silent and did not cause appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "disgusting":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom he had served.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company that he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is happy to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Unobjectionable!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambican and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not say any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that the state has already heavily insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza is lacking morals and serving the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has only served on the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state to act as an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become weary of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarding.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison Samora Machel will not only remember the Mozambians as the first independent president, but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>

<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not like that. he changes tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network launched their posts from the network, because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censuses the word "Kalar" or "Kalar" (in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt for the purpose of its use have also been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookeeper Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar'so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to relieve his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing at Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (age bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experience of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started deleting his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their views against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his mail was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook is removed.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author gave his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to lessen racism in Burma through their platform, but that's not how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "" "" "it also seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as" "" "" "" "chair" "" "" "" "or" hereditary curry "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among the users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are making fun on Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate language to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the Burmese text reads" "" "" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat a pea curry and watch an Indian film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "just to try out if Facebook removes the mail that contains the word Kalar." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1334">The post says "If you are a doctor, then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the congregations in Myanmar, especially in Rakhine area, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticised for his failure to control the rampant hate speech on his Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical focal point confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys under 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements seeking to abolish laws for the toe of children followed at the foot and rejoiced with great support. they doubtless helped bring about this outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children's marriage, they should, damn, take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated case, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill was adopted against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent living room, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where already a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now only the President of the country has to agree and let the law be announced." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the senators of the country gave on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not a single against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage were finally amended.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk which disguised the heart of the matter, but you know what? the toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost any price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day finally arrived:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook from Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which states:,, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been approved.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Foley Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The professable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now 18 years independent of religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the change of the married network was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There were 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>

<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible catch comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the country's best-known Hindu organisation.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take legal steps, the law was to be passed away, and he seems to have made his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General, Paris Al rawi, an advocate of the law, said that it is absolutely legitimate if Maharaj wants to act against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if, instead of holding the discussion so broadly, in a way that only encourages panic and disgrace, instead of talking about the problem that we, our daughters prevent it from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are in favor of them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to court proceedings against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child marriages are legal or the norm in various gradations, even though there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright law in the United States, internationally darkened.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series defend themselves against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy web users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia, as described recently in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">After China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer-calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, however, irrevocable in spite of the legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (via Wikipedia), we made it possible to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipea.org itself.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansichupedi.org, a mirror site from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites, when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as employees of Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL that is not the original. that which you can see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server forwards the request to the correct Wikipedia page, making it possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">For this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around himself. they were blurred with badly positioned motives and washed colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and to try to straighten out the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook, how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navaraj (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a phone call from my father that would be a leopard on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was located and I immediately started to crush pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he stood facing tigers before face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the baggage appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for" (lit.: I click on the protection of the environment) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband as a result of social pressure, and fear of the consequences should they ignore the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced by a pseudo-court from the Indian state of Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer penalties to fear, if at all, they should not come back to this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club, thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">Being one of the 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the Video Volunteers community and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">For seven years, Rohini Pap has been working with the help of her video camera to expose practices such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV and AIDS, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time they made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video showing Rohini in their discussion was of women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open up a discussion on the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands according to their husbands is a custom which they all hold out dutifully and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and desires a long life for him.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered a deceitful thing, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who so far had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband lingered long after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked everyone, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paola from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chained only in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by blaspheming him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it for dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "" "" "another woman said," "" "" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of one of the participants was less understanding and the situation was in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing the zinced red dot on the forehead that shows the marriage status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinced red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we make a trip at every discussion club." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "" "" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear what" "" "" "", "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">For the first time in their lives they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang, talking about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example, like our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salsa Kurta, a wide shirt across a trouser; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of discussion and discussion about the advantages of the own choice of clothing, morality linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own pair of Kurdistan (upper shirts) into a discussion, so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question as to whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini reaffirms that things are moving slowly into roles:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped referring to her husband's name.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are involved.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like violets for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1547">The Beatles during her landing in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1548">Screenshot of the official Beatles YouTube channel.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th this year, the hashtag was the hashtag to be found in the Japanese Twitter Trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed Beatles 1964 in London, noticed in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days, the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here became clear quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka told, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan. more than 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English teaching at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll is supposed to represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it belongs to fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the familiar places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">When you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (Memorial in New York)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">The pilgrimages can sometimes not be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran through Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year too.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms, such as this Ramen-Shop (Ramen are Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen!! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>
<seg id="1578">"" "" "" "I will listen to" "" "" "" "Yesterday" "" "" "" "today and eat Ramen-noodles at Mutaro Koya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1579">This is how the day is going to take place today.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for deserted purposes, is disturbing the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they believed that the organs of shamans are used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">It gave the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman of Zambézia to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the target of murders for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN was carrying out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Husum Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhammoe in the south of Mozambique said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Moravibala, province of Zambézia, for presumably abnormal rituals has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha on Facebook shared the chronicles of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1625">Free Bassel: Netizen Under Serious Threat, December 2012 (in English) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel prize laureates and dissident Liu Xiaobo</seg>
<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his attorney announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as "an internal affair," and said a spokesman, he considered it "not necessary to discuss this issue with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">A spokesman, however, refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union of European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The leading diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Lius, as she announced in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time, we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they desire, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad shared with him that the American "wants him to have the possibility of treating abroad, in so far as he can help him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth-Polley, announced on 27 June to the AFP news agency that the Embassy would ask the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The US Embassy's call came to a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1659">Germany, Germany and Switzerland</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hope that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs, "and that a" humanitarian "solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority."</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 Summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported to the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns whether the vortex for Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada through Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room at the hospital and that it is Liu not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to talk and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom to exercise those rights." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and surroundings</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Office requested China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments that he, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan and Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental matters in Taiwan called on China to release Liu on 27 June and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progress Party also called on China to allow the ill-intellectual liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned with Liu on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domain Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of this, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old Lyre emerges from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, leave the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given last week by Shanmugam were really not answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial system, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He dealt with relevant questions in a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to express his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point, if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, Anon points out the critics that one should start reading the complete transcript of the conference in order to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">When he said that Singapore is rather a "city" than a country, "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections.</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "" "" "when he said that Singapore" "" "" "" "is not a country," "" "" "" "he obviously didn't mean it in this sense!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am very embarrassed about what the US Justice Minister said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Has Mr. Shanmugam "faithfully committed a mistake" or was it a Freudian loudspeaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is both land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore pay their military service, but they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>

<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have angered many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians perhaps cook outrageous in anger if they are held for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little difference between Canadians and Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1769">If Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing to push.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not deserve attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop-band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the junta, which in 2014 took power and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, still govern the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man telling what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically, the music video still refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">In the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even Charlie Chaplin's video "The dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists called on the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as regards the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video that refers to some of the political issues that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">The "44 rules of girls" may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives absolute decision making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The 11th rule: "change your attitude" refers to the notorious program of "change in settings" by journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are regarded by the junta as a critic.</seg>
<seg id="1791">The image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often exploited by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was also set up in the army that monitors online content and prosecutes people accused of having perpetuated the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand employs a strict sentencing of "Lese Majeste" (majesty insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it became a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems faced by the junta is their decision to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that buying would be unnecessary and a waste of taxes.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The video even shows how people are thrown into a black van, before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile, the teaser of the songs showed members of the band that imitated the Salut from "The Tribute of Panem," which was already used by putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured ear rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the vestibule there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms Ramírez, the people are coming into full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also have slept outside on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are ill, she buys drugs that she can't pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa is an appropriate nickname for Ms. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "" "" "he answers with a smile." "" "" "" "I really feel it suits her as African women are very nice women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao leaves with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and three children again.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They lived in Brazil but it is for some Africans that are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">"" "" "" "he has been guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs Ramírez says that her guests often send her text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that their Christian faith is the driving force of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have received migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "" "" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an all-in-one, offered him its roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where the next step is to take.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Afrika, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, the travellers silently consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">MS Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leavens her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many more traveler more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughed sadly, while she briefly presented her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-in for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, for the use of the most advanced user environments.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a phone notification in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "" "" "it is said that the app" "" "" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities were able to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they had messed up news with a private WeChat group just after they had installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists together with illegal religious activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend on-line and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with minors will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China tend to focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit disturbances and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China" based on Twitter, published in China, published the censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the inhabitants randomly, whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be detained for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use equipment intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (in a so-called "spotting") also published a Jingwang product description from which the software can lift up the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus obtain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Jingwang regulations may have a response to the instructions of the city party council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All governmental branches, authorities and associated facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities issued an ordinance on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the instruction to let all residents and entrepreneurs register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any terrorist videos. however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible violations, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="1999">But when the reality gets back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death.</seg>
<seg id="2000">All doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence, even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of evil. it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls of your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone for stone.</seg>

<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by screaming several times "Allahu akbar" from my house roof.</seg>

<seg id="2053">I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person: the Raad (about: "thunder," allusion to 13 Sure des Koran).</seg>
<seg id="2054">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they are here to be heard." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2055">Thus the secret was vented: to protect the state security against us and to prevent us from exposing the traitors and terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitian dialect - so they played their confessional heiress card and betrayed the close look of their world view.</seg>
<seg id="2056">This is not a house that is not a country; it is a curse that they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their clans into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">I enter the listening room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he does so.</seg>
<seg id="2058">He starts a "pleasant" conversation, despite the facial expressions that glide him: "my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than to join these Tagediver and protest on demonstrations that will soon be an end."</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it, not to respond.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I really can no longer say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Any voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had not done anything to make this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">On penalty in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner will delight in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">Give him pleasure, you can't measure yourself with him and you can't hold back your cries.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My cries were not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable.</seg>
<seg id="2071">At my first arrest, I asked if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment.</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to show us the magnificent invention of a giant cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2075">The executioner saw the cooling down and didn't take any pleasure in it, which is why it picked up next to an electrically charged wand.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">My naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he strolls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives on the top floor of his family house, which has been theirs since 1967; the year when Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (like: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, opposing the conservative majority and questioning its well-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">At the age of 25, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathize with people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special dislike against American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war zones has anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation." he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," Hdaib stresses.</seg>
<seg id="2104">Then he adds: "I think, because I am a man," while he pours in water-dissolved Nescafé into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset.</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Apparently Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking down with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam in a hot junk day.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the sludge speaks warm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose principally of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially when you look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the general public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry, Jordaniens, has already cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert cancellation.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokesmen of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was cancelled "straight" because of the sexiness of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activity, which raises the well-established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," which continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement might well not be simply shallow rhetoric, but actually reflect a reality that is increasingly evident in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib retreated traditional gender norms to Leibe by drafting his vision of the fate of Arab women who have had a premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently deformed unidentified woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In recent years, the number of 'honourable mordes' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outwardly left.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honours reached its peak in 2016; however, it is even more difficult that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to the 1954 breaching law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure, as well as the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known to not shy away from any issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit allusions on sexuality, freedom and freedom of expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "" "" "politics have been told me," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in essence can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song called "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats itself often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where, in his words, "that can get what you want" - whether it's faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014 Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya to later point out that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and his opinion had been censored.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires openly for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not consistent with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poetry.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert has been cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the realm of the Hashemite it is nothing new that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adhered to several former members of the government and members of the teaching association with the reason that they have critically expressed themselves on comments in social media about the problems rooted in the country's deep-rooted corruption.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaibs concert is, according to opinion, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, deliberate and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will be approached with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially-led democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue racking and, consequently, resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nabuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebula festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forts, drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time in which armies from west Japan have marched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the emishi, to their knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">You can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, hosted a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">For a long time I look forward to the Meguro-Gajoen: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">External appearances and body care have rarely been as important as in this history, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from criminality and promote a legitimate profession such as the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region cannot feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the fancy hairstyles of famous sportsmen like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the seasoned hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts compete against each other to show who can create the most centric looks of them, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile of Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to trade their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive a training in the hairdressing art instead of bad ratings, which enables them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported on some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only school in the commune and the district, which we are very proud of, because we built this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Used with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the "love message to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article will be published as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is precisely the question of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Reconciliación (Letters to Reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government closed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">But before the Colombian people there is still a long way to speak of a real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and had their weapons around the clock, now have to integrate themselves into the lives of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once again accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred toward guerrilla fighters, now has to take them into their ranks and support them in the creation of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians had to join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign aims to receive 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly talk to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but those who need them more needless.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He also told us to share his love with people that needed most of the most pressing attention this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to deliver the letters personally.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members stood up as they used to take the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for all involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where guerrilla fighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go, because next to him on the bed there was a mGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "" "" "he answered," "" "" "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "someone has never written something like that in my life, so I answer it." "" "" "" "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and sat down beside the garnet.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war, he felt sorry to be the loyal companion of this combatant all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had expected anything else from life as a war. joining the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now that peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">For the start, students and some of the leaders of the FARC gathered for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when war prevailed and the FARC was already in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC explained the history of the organization, its ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have seen how social injustice by the state took effect on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "" "" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "" "" "said one of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard hearing and had no right to vote, and recognizing that the people whom I often saw as monsters and even had learned to hate, even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all humans - including those who killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter for example Daría de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities exist, there will always be people who are willing to resort to arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we of the FARC are now focusing on peace, a policy without weapons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and make sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015, I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to fetch some shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a man's voice saying, "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">Then I heard another phrase, but this time in Chechnya: "how long do you still honor the family, you Schandeleck?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, no 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had got everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In hospital I learned that I had two stab wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which hospitals were you laid - in the men or the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, my male name is still on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very thankful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got to do it with fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having dealt with me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than one month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said I must prove it by running up without the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender that everything was just bad speech and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people spoke to my mother once on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "" "" "they said to her," "" "" "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has corrupted not only your family but the entire republic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "" "" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">There was too much to my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car under the window with dark windows and a number sign with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering without notice, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I received a message: "you do not believe, you would be safe, only because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I really try to look at how the person looks at which she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had settled in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">I mean, they probably invite relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced satisfaction through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there is not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives, in order to judge himself as a Cadet's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply gone, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person himself was there when these people were taken with them.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but so far there have been no reports. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grozny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst's case!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia wanted to introduce us to" "" "" "" "Civilization" "" "" "", "but ultimately threw us back to the Stone Age." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never made me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian Theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks were standing, and the whole city knew of it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language, there is a saying: Kharshma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were sick?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long has this time of grace held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but rather about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he who had smiled and laughed at first looked at you once with suspicion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: which activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a penny for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I clicked away places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same thing as Chechens, who want to know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays in them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanes have which, the cabarins have which, the Russians also have; on the whole planet there are they - but not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know many think of transient to men who love men, and they believe that one changes their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling, to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it's the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'll be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide among the impoverished Arab Ahvtsi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate among the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahraz.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27 re-faced the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is marked by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his helplessness, his inability to stand up for his family, according to Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahraz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames and Moramazi was brought to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August in the Arab Anwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family fathers who were helpless and unable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work because of the persecution by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi, living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it hard for the native Arab population to contend its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahraz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the wealthiest and most valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi-Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a large variety of trunks that redirect water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawk youths has now risen to 81%." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, announced that 5% of Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed a secondary school of 55% and have completed a university degree of 45%.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohizi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not pretend to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside their homeland of Ahraz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahrazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speaking the Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activist alert the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectionist not"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - respond with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite the same education, women nowadays still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women face a glass ceiling sooner or later, and that discrimination based on sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and threefold under it.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, black Cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused by racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they don't want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalised form of racist-motivated violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about the fact that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men to have the same rights at all; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in which the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustice in her mind, which refer to both sex and skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "" "" "and even I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an appalling and marginalized being in historical terms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural assimilation in order to advance their egocentric programme." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlap of skin colour and sex. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different origins a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to completely rid myself of feminism and join the movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they can be perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and marginalization after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment where my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2469">Again and again Nabil Musa travelled over the past seven years - mostly with surfboard or in canoe - with a special request by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations.</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," said Musa.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers, brooks and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources. "</seg>
<seg id="2474">At the end of the video, Musa summarizes urgency and importance of his work on a question: "if we had no more water, how would we survive then?"</seg>
<seg id="2475">This video was filmed and filmed for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, an Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist.</seg>
<seg id="2476">The focus of her work lies on persecuted, sparse subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of suppressed congregations, who can tell their stories in their own way.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by Celle. the article belongs to the series # PorSermujer (# weighteinefrault), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected people.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police commissioner, Ada Báez, said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of her relationship some time has passed and the police said her statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman presented Balbuena on account of abuse, Ada Báez also took advantage of the accurate display of Ada Báez.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her display.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women complain at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women, who admit, be victims of violence, report to the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">MyrrGonzález, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institute in Paraguay says, "There are different statements and reports, but they do not even point to the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney General presented 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the peace courts. here, too, 86% of women's ads came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated. "on every woman who has been refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not do so.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this come to every woman who has been charged with physical abuse." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's homicide in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The co-ordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At first she didn't want that, but then she gave up. that should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would once be victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happened to women who are too submissive, because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook, describing his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity to blame.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for nearly eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner was mistreated.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that is made up of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorian's case, everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner finally managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's ads with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Women's Organization in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# fürstendamm).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and # NiUnaMenos (# nonentity) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original bill of the law foresees to explain and punish feminists for a perpetual crime, as is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the legislative text was changed in some points in order to win the MEPs for the law, which feared that it would pave the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and are punished with up to five years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must bear in the present time, if they simply want to submit a complaint and wish to receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature has no sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay maltreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethink must take place here, so that violence is no longer seen as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever remains silent in the face of these facts makes him guilty and contributes to the perpetrators of offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to reimburse for such a long time until maltreatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed before, among other things, a passage that the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>

<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Catalan authorities closed the independent Arabic language Azamn for its reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he served as a prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri were arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having abolished his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only sultan, the main offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular the domestic trade secret, the public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restricting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, intimidating and instigating.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn newspaper, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and distribution of the paper is prohibited on any means, including online, from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the trial of Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the trial in Maskat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the paper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet," and "undermining the prestige of the state."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of violating a ban on the public and the slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years' imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3000 omania Rial (US $7800). in addition, a yearling ban against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he found guilty of the use of "an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a security deposit of 5000 omega (13000 US dollars) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>

<seg id="2572">The Appeals Chamber also revoked the decision of the Ministry of Intelligence to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Catalan government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of "Azamn" for three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information, personally signed another order in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended for three additional months, with which the minister once again filed an appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal to allow publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The continuing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the paper are not the only cases in which the press freedom was violated in Oman in recent times.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper, to cease operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the arrest of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Iranian authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, figure takes place with his approval</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or even mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: for one thing there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grave consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a big problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists helps to build up its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the continent's economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is director of the central laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, especially when the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus, before deciding to go back home in order to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: right now the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what are your opinion about the important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient instead of being a creators.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, because the financing and the opportunities for development are better in other countries." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you haven't had before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how large do you think is the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for specific scientific training, beginning at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research into space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The system means that magazines are only accessible against payment (the so-called "Paywall"), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research.</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the US to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own imagination and the question of how many kinds of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as grain or carton varieties. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millenary old tradition, Morton is still breeding Salad, but meanwhile it takes longer, since his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is as if a boulder in a river is lying around which I have to jump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think these patents go too far for salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new kind of salad, because all the features are patented. "he continues to do as much as possible and try to breed the characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">In doing so, however, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and throughout the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman salat of the Outside Gorgeous in the "Greenhouse" of the station. it tests whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name rather sounds as if the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi in short, US breeders can commit themselves to freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed them in order to breed their own varieties and not to immediately choose them - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger groups such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by cultivating seed with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg points out that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, he says and takes on the ever-increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, whose recent examples are the merging of food products, such as farmers markets, should also know that the way in which this vegetables are grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "" "" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to keep their seeds freely available to others. in contrast, their approach is in contrast to patenting seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, because the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the growing intellectual property rights of plant material, which is therefore always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders either at all or only aggravated.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not exist yet, but experts like Luby assume that massive cultivated plants such as wheat can be patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specific desired characteristics - from those, through which their taste or color improves through to such, because of which they flourish in certain environments and endure threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are far worse forseeable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also decisive for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and the cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It does, however, contradict the view that intellectual property has other breeders as "patents and the protection of plant varieties foster innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">Thus, such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it in a different way: to wait for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one has to wait so long to grow crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost.</seg>
<seg id="2669">But the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make agriculture easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "" "" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is bothering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics: "we do not really create the features themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation methods produce herbicides, which breeds the concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "" "" "my concept is gentoo." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets but are smaller than Monsanto) patents, they create most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also the opinion that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>

<seg id="2683">The US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, but the concept is spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the area of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crop varieties, the Centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agrecol works on an open source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding are different from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot simply be one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>

<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference entitled "Open Source" seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, non-governmental organisations and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the "Open Source" seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patents on seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for "Open Source" seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for "Open Source" seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled for next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A consortium of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>
<seg id="2693">In September, Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food, has published a report from aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others.</seg>
<seg id="2694">The report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context in which Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize him.</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how it is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in this process," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organization and blog are the latest goals of the Censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still lock up content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time, it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government locked up the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) website, which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports on the same.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remained true despite this attack and the mockering of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who were supposed to defend the law and to give a voice to victims in this part of the world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 webpages more than two months ago, for example the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the network of Al Jazeera from Qatar because of alleged "support for terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web side barriers to victims. @ anhri is one of the main sources of human rights in the Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziaja used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for web pages and media not accessible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, even the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with which Ziaja's blog is also located, is on the other hand accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziaja, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, when he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve mainly around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziva commented on the government's blockage and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogging blog is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blogging of blogs may not be significant to the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has been possible for them to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, an invitation to the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked up 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blocking of providers, which was possible by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blockage of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intent of the government to continue blocking and filtering contents to which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these acts.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants fight.</seg>

<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos pública, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in Brazil report a gloomy headline from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves robs pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air tea to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">The newspaper "Extra" published in Rio on August 16 published the editorial "This is not normal" in which it announced to set up a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city will be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in any major city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. all that differs from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, Editor-in-Chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war crusade in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist told the newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 domains controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse when it is distorted can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues violence as a "war." this is, in their opinion, a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold accountability to the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - combined with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-fitable neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">Calling Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and north-east of the country. these are the most up-to-date data available.</seg>

<seg id="2779">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if we look at the Mordrats per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "" "" "she writes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is an extra member of the Global South American company, the largest media company in South America, which, like Cecília, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">One of these security policy measures was the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying massive police orders and permanently stationing one unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">Initially, this led to a decline of violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP has been bombarded by harassment and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux of one of his articles from 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria established by the Geneva Conventions for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also pulls serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use resources and ways that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas in Rio continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">One week ago, the police freed up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho, to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident struck headlines too: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations, and the Syrian opposition assume that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these zones controlled by rebels have been under siege outside of Damascus, causing residents to be reliant on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional food like meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how to plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alessida and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are very rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many regional capitals in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the week before in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government called for a state dispute the last week of solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also recorded in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached approximately 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 fatalities and more than 200 injured by fires.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite images, in Portugal alone, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2847">João Soveral of the Federation of Farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building approvals in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law allowing the construction activity to fall if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval continues in the same article in the newspaper Público.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, spread more and more according to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Portugal Civil Defence on October 15 and 16, when residents were looking for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it used to use the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched by the developer João Pina in 2015 to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the server did not hold the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million requests.</seg>

<seg id="2875">At that time, Asharaf Barati was a 13-year-old boy belonging to the ethnic group of Hazara, in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Even if his mother didn't tell it then she knew that she would not see her son for a long time - maybe never again.</seg>
<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy should break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many hazara suddenly felt vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf again found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his low wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Ashareholding recalled in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabitated Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashareholes came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary persons twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high number quotas, but it is also true that the conditions for asylum seekers in the country are disastrous.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "" "" "the Civil Liberties Union for Europe" "" "" "" "human rights organisation writes the system" "" "" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">The majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 "special reception centres." these are improvised institutions in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel. "</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they officially apply for asylum - which can be drawn for months after the registration of the asylum request.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also called Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf inserted his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film received the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxation and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years a number of Afghans have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Oriental Experience restaurant in which the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant narrates the history of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomic and retail trade and aim to return to the country he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," "" "" "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "" "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2924">"" "" "" "they represent half of society and have the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf also forged plans for opening a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey of uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>

<seg id="2928">Netizen report: bill drafts from Egypt enable the shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, for more than 900 days in jail.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the Raba'a el Adaweya camp in Cairo, protesting against the release of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo taken by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament checks a bill that provides users with social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks, register within six months after successful law on the authority's website, stating their full name and identification number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to a prison sentence of up to six months or a criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another MP filed a legislative proposal in which harder penalties for the insult of the president or a high official would be introduced.</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the offence of the President and government institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">Moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photographs of Egyptian police officers demonstrating against the military coup that led to the inauguration of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident, Shawkan was waiting four years in jail for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, apparent burden of others arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mossad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seating block on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the charges of the journalists, Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa, and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Listening to Tunisian activists to enforced documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours listening to Sami Ben Gharbia, who was co-founder of Nawaat's independent media platform and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to an action plan that had been levied. according to the plan, the President of the Republic, according to the plan, was explicitly backed by a controversial law bill, which was accused by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided all funds returned unlawfully.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website poses a light on how the presidential agenda looks like to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to mention his sources, stating Articles 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which journalists safeguarding the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he appeared as a witness in the District Court of Tunis on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the information bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the regulations it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that by this the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved within social networks. it is unclear to date how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only selectively assert these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat?"</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roskomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as "organiser of the distribution of information" in the state government.</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government lists a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and forcing them upon request for the issuance of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites are currently websites such as VContacts and Odnoclassiniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court decreed Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ruled Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to clear two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication announced that the site had been blocked because it became "an information source that cooperates with groups to intensify a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, next to, China, one of the few countries around the world, in which access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK can't stop sniffing around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's leaked documents, the UK government finds itself in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communication in real time and install tampering programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation runs until May 19. reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
