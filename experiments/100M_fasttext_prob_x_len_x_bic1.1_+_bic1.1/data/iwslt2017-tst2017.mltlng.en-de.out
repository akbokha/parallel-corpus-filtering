that is James Ris@@ en .
they probably know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA listened illeg@@ ally to Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered proposals to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has identified threats and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and to spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish confidential information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the cour@@ a@@ geous that they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked on cracks , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en had to go to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although they told years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks .
the reason : during electronic monitoring , repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of failing to fail and to make cracks , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , got his telephone number secret ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit return , and even travel information with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack assumed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary was more convic@@ ted than all the US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as secret .
from September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everybody .
but just like the government &apos;s technology allows journalists to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in touch rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communication software , which did not yet exist as ris@@ ings had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and today it has been enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access to .
so the government can no longer secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker who warns the alarm of the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street in@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data corner of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money were hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a saying : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set it up ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box offices in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next un@@ veiled documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should we do that ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of a few are being used to hide and obsc@@ ure their fortun@@ es -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people around the world seem very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who were in these revelations , this sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but by the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the United States .
in fact , in some US states , you need less information to give less information to start a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
it has allowed che@@ aters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here in Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked ourselves that all up to one lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to them . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our secret investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must change the rules to make this sort of behaviour more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this may sound very sensi@@ bly , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see that things have started to change .
in the past few years , we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to ending this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally finish the in@@ transparency , which now enables this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story , as I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while paying the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ da !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I bring up there ?
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on tips to the door and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my viewpoint .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ...
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pulled off and the rent is increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something for it . our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , WLAN and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so @-@ called &quot; Air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on wooden floors for 20 dollars .
they found it great , and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets ta@@ sted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we left our last guest and the door to the castle fell , Brian and I star@@ ed at it .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former co @-@ worker , N@@ ate Ble@@ w@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it .
this is how we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms - the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
over the Internet they can invite wild strangers to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children , we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you ins@@ ist on the things you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your cell phone .
give your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only once , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please tell us on Twitter that he is can@@ dic@@ ated for the office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 convic@@ tions , all of them say : &quot; he really can hold fast un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to give up your phone ?
a well thought out feedback system strengthens trust significantly .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed down their assessments before placing them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we looked at how likely it is for people to trust each other , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when one adds the call of a person -- in our case by condem@@ nations .
if you have less than three judgments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation suff@@ ices in common .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are revealing .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you &apos;re told too little , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will not get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; the request is not accepted rather . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le works of art in your home ! I &apos;ll go on holiday with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can you create a design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbelievable good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a demand that had not been met before .
for us , the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who were un@@ authorised parties or have ra@@ v@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts if I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , the 123 million overnight stays had only a fraction of a problem .
for men rightly trusted one another .
when trust functions , wonderful things can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one thing .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay is going on .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled across this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing go together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the matter is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people open a part of themselves and that changes everything .
when travelling today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visit , a group there would be waiting for a group there to fill a thoroughly and to show one in a ta@@ pent@@ ine neighborhood , of which one has never heard ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thought of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of isolation and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children had moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host .
so the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was also available before .
there were similar websites before us .
so , why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing we realized that we can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big impact , I wonder what we will be able to use in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in securing the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media are people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rots @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga singing , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , opposite the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and believed in the end .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that somebody is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ?
this is how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do such a thing ?
I switched to the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; Bom@@ bs Mek@@ ka ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the United States to move into a new city and start a post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I felt -- when we went to silence -- as deep as I was sitting in my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said , &quot; Be vi@@ gil@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; do not fru@@ strate yourselves . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were believed to be Muslims and struck down .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this land attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less , because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be a few parking spaces , but not stopping terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more toler@@ ant people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as I recently told me a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.@@ C. recently : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
during the radic@@ alization process it has been found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can do bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads to the fact that the person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or rejected by faith .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , as the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both groups claim their ideology in their &quot; Holy Book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but when you take a look at them , it does not exagger@@ ate what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scriptures . &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality , which lets them read these things in the Scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister he spoke with was sil@@ enced and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger , she was a main goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts that promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m established the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family were concerned .
but how does normal Americans work ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we tend to accept an author@@ itarian governmental system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
a study reveals that when people submit messages that were reported negative about Muslims , they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
when you see when the mood against Muslims cre@@ pt up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when it comes to the allocation of collective debt , it is not just about having to explain itself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living at Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; when did I become such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon .
he shot on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal , not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or stayed at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , went to the hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assemblies were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you &apos;re holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fo@@ ol@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
if people like an exception tend to appear , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you so much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air parcel delivery penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they started to fly with ropes .
connecting units allows air devices to reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space .
they can also build resili@@ ent structures independently .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it must be coll@@ ectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , calculate calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands are available on the highest level e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight machine that tries to beat two birds with a flap .
like other starter motors , it is efficient in advance flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations .
in contrast to most starter motors it can float , and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit does not matter in what position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
OK . OK .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter .
such a question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which join together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one thing works .
this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically easiest remotely operated flight machine . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , one prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , inside life very much happens so that it can fly steady and move in the room everywhere .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right in the right place is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cont@@ ent@@ ment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in excess .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
move in space in all directions , no matter what direction it rot@@ ates or even rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate twin prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when they are assembled , they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
however , if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller comes off , the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly , if limited .
we will demonstrate this by making half of it f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration sc@@ rut@@ ini@@ zes synthetic spon@@ ges .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression .
we recorded commercial Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ve around each other in a very far away gal@@ axy , transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second to pure energy .
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was born on Earth .
since then the earth has produced some things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work , they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ ometer gravit@@ ational @-@ wave @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to solve some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been examining gravit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories as lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals .
a wave of gravit@@ ation is a ru@@ ff@@ ling in the texture of space and time .
when the shaft is pulled over , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and st@@ owed in the other .
instructors in courses on rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really sil@@ ly dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on the 14th of September , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us when hitting the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by a 1 . for this reason , one explained the Lig@@ o staff crazy .
with a five kilometer laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
drove Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder Lig@@ os , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can make a picture or map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming around you from several points .
it &apos;s different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible , to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
for your child &apos;s face , for example .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to connect to the story behind it .
&quot; right now , Alice &quot; speaks .
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot;
&quot; dum@@ b Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound we can hear the universe literally .
to listen to the gravity , we can tell us about the colli@@ sions of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular easy : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies turn very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to listen to , recognizes this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s briefly think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling around a hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
in this there is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practically or fundamentally -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ ghty stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes occur in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through as these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail @-@ light .
with the help of gravit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in the universe that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as lig@@ o observed them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies of pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the birth of the stars and ultimately , how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I experim@@ ented with an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected item . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; pussy , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; -@@ say for playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like , wake up to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce TV .
I make television in a grand scale .
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days at four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so above all . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who still makes this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to impress you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I say to you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fan@@ ta@@ sies , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not about dre@@ aming in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I step into the work , there is no other sense .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you make a high note , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could always drive on it .
many people believe that when I explain to them the sums , I &apos;m writing over writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the sums -- when I began working with television production when I began to work and work and to work , create , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the voice is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t asp@@ ire differently to size .
the feeling of not being able to asp@@ ire to size , no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
maybe it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I only this tot@@ em ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
re@@ worked , over@@ stressed , exagger@@ ated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mother is a single working institution .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pussy , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , elabor@@ ated weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with all my heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no h@@ um .
there was silence in me .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programmes , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ titanium ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing was me .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly f@@ ading out the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gras@@ shop@@ per , stupid author @-@ titanium . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you &apos;re doing what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , being a mother , being a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no , when two things become clear to me :
first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she did not call me &quot; pussy . &quot;
she does not call anyone more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my hum@@ ming smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of sum@@ ming , I can &apos;t do anything except to fit .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist any more .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; lets go .
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost enters .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something we forgot .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titanium dioxide , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the tot@@ em is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it is simply love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the bu@@ zz again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t have to play as much as you work .
the truth is painful ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work , because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a man rather works than to be home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we ro@@ de around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent , and confused .
I always take my mobile .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me .
and I am talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes by play !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are in !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
in order to &quot; play &quot; in general .
have a look at the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and save yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; want to play ? &quot; stands for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes on the piece , why not treat yourself for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the tot@@ em , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my hum@@ ming .
the sum of life .
the sum of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
it &apos;s me sni@@ p that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a titanium , the journey to Jerusalem is playing .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children are .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz , the other , the right sum : the bu@@ zz of life .
the more I feel this tot@@ um , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new attitude towards life is spreading within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this tot@@ um , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things look like I &apos;m getting you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans don &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to deal with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
that is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the neuro@@ surgeon &apos;s dream is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help themselves .
history started 15 years ago .
at the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain and increases the cran@@ ial pressure in the skull @-@ brain trauma .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to succeed .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they were disper@@ sed slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they account for 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of fo@@ etus , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so secure .
one thing is clear however -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step , we re @-@ implemented them at the receiving point of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario we re @-@ opened the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we caused an injury and re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we d@@ yed in vitro , in culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the motor skills area in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it happened to humans , they spontaneously re@@ treated to some degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as is the case with monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now that we re @-@ reim@@ plant@@ ated the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were exciting results for us as well .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials at humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , one has to fill approximately two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to launch it soon ?
then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then it is necessary to apply this to a multic@@ enter study .
first you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to regard them as imm@@ utable poetry .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and an impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy van@@ ishes with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally made clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs realised in Greece .
at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succ@@ umb to a mistake , we could save ourselves from democracy , but that we need a true and defensive democracy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for without democracy our societies will glo@@ at , our future glo@@ omy and waste our great new technologies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the topic of waste , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the twin summit parad@@ ox .
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , who are too anxi@@ ous to invest in where it would be productive and contribute to the production of the debt and also produce all the things that humanity desper@@ ately needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like much money , until it compar@@ es it to the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar , which at the same time circul@@ ated in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing , except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and boost the real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital are the twin peaks that are not mutually exclusive by the usual market mechanisms .
the result are stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low general economic demand which , as in a final loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , out of fear , the prophecy of the bull might be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up ,
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
that is my hatred with capitalism --
his exceedingly wast@@ eful kind . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents , and to finance especially all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive aspect of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote wei@@ ghting in questions of the state concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy hasn &apos;t lasted too long --
like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a statute for rulers .
for liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this division of politics and economics began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle took place between the two , as the economy gradually sub@@ filtr@@ ated and deprived them of politics .
wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of DNA .
it is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power , because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that have so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they star@@ ve at the end .
it is similar to the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is increasing , political goods are being de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ assemble the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , aside from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and the social conflicts more deeply , just as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we must re@@ structure the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which he produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell .
in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no distinction between those who belong to enterprises , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not belonging to it . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no huge twin peaks .
in the area of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely wa@@ vering exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
suppose the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kosmos &apos; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund .
imagine that these funds are investing in green technologies , especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is simultaneously the secretary in which it fav@@ ors privileged persons , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the tr@@ ash bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , globally Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we jointly decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will dest@@ abili@@ ze not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant .
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I &apos;m totally cha@@ otic .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you are not confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Ein@@ stein who said this . BG : in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s perspective on China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century , sm@@ ells immen@@ sely in hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Ministers at the start of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
that is to say good@@ bye to the compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the permanent den@@ ial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone , and continues to mas@@ sively thre@@ aten the development of the whole European Union .
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way , was the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro Group , have continued to den@@ ounce den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to keep alive through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the change happens , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone does not have a future unless we change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BA : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , asser@@ ts that he has made no mistake then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the Eurozone .
they did not want to admit that they had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika credi@@ tors imposed on this policy said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone against comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone doesn &apos;t survive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centrifu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to embar@@ k on the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 what it seems to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price , most of them have never heard even though he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy had three years ago .
Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ horn and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire , &quot; all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to sign &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and , through an evaluation , sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon releases things for nothing , one does not intervene correctly ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know that they are being watched when watching these shows .
they are being watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , what parts you jump over or check again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
in fact , they collect the data , process it and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com via four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find this one super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have watched the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give to the shows , what shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data se@@ eded companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is the reason ?
because logic says that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work out this way , it &apos;s a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that due to data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , they can predict -- by analy@@ zing Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked fine , year by year around year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this once again was a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ supported genetics -- an area where some very smart people in@@ conceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years , I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a second , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and to understand its parts .
they are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision .
for that there is another tool and we all own it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is to put parts and pieces together again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they are also part of the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they vie for TV ideas when they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there were data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; right here at this moment .
I will fight it out later with a technique demo .
I have made a few decisions in my life so far , where I should have heard in hin@@ d@@ sight on the ball .
but , of course , as you know when you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , to be an expert in what one is doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
