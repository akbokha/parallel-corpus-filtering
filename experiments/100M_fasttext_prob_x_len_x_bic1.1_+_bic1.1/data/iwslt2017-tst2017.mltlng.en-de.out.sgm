<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They probably know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA listened illegally to Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally delivered proposals to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For nearly 10 years, the government has identified threats and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish confidential information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous that they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked on cracks, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, Risen had to go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they told years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: during electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failing to fail and to make cracks, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, got his telephone number secret,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like its e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit return, and even travel information with the list of its flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack assumed source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary was more convicted than all the US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">From September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional addition, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everybody.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just like the government's technology allows journalists to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in touch rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software, which did not yet exist as risings had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and today it has been enhanced by the Freedom of the Press Foundation.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access to.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer secretly procure information, and many of the information it would ask would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have a chance to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker who warns the alarm of the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data corner of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] [enormous sums of money were hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were asked of news about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Mossack Fonseca saying: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set it up?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox offices in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of US $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next unveiled documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">All over the world, media and leading politicians like secret tax havens of a few are being used to hide and obscure their fortunes -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people around the world seem very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this issue in the USA." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because so far there have been no prominent Americans who were in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">But by the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming, Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US states, you need less information to give less information to start a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed cheaters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here in Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator was an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we really shocked ourselves that all up to one lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to them. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our secret investigator." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="81">In order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we must change the rules to make this sort of behaviour more difficult." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound very sensibly, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see that things have started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">In the past few years, we have seen more transparency as regards the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "since then, the EU has been gathering in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need ordinary people angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake firms." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "" "" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and commit to ending this kind of intransparency by laws." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "together, we can finally finish the intransparency, which now enables this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story, as I almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "" "" "while paying the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "" "" "where are you sleeping tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "" "" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazda!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "" "" "then I heard:" "" "" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "" "" "a voice in my head said," "" "" "" "Ah, how please?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what did I bring up there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on tips to the door and shut down my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my viewpoint.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulled off and the rent is increased." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something for it. our apartment is a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, WLAN and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so-called "Air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on the air mattress on wooden floors for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we left our last guest and the door to the castle fell, Brian and I stared at it.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former co-worker, Nate Blewczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">This is how we presented the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms - the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can invite wild strangers to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children, we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you insist on the things you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it's the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only once, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell us on Twitter that he is candicated for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor first presented himself with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 convictions, all of them say: "he really can hold fast unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to give up your phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought out feedback system strengthens trust significantly.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had handed down their assessments before placing them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we looked at how likely it is for people to trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when one adds the call of a person -- in our case by condemnations.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation suffices in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "" "" "if you're told too little, such as" "" "" "" "Hi!," "" "" "" "you will not get an answer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "" "" "you tell too much, for example:" "" "" "" "I have problems with my mother," "" "" "" -- "the request is not accepted rather." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "" "" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "" "" "" "Tolle works of art in your home! I'll go on holiday with my family." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create a design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the large amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievable good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a demand that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unauthorised parties or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts if I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, the 123 million overnight stays had only a fraction of a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men rightly trusted one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust functions, wonderful things can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one thing.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital if you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They leave one even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay is going on.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled across this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing go together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade here.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but to call it simply" "" "" "" "rental industry" "" "" "", "the matter is not justified." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People open a part of themselves and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When travelling today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visit, a group there would be waiting for a group there to fill a thoroughly and to show one in a tapentine neighborhood, of which one has never heard;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thought of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of isolation and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children had moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to be able to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be guests with a stranger or even host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems not to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also available before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So, why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing we realized that we can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we will be able to use in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in securing the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrots-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Qur'an.</seg>

<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the television channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Jihad..."... "Bombs Mekka!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned into a suspects.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the United States to move into a new city and start a postgraduate course.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I felt -- when we went to silence -- as deep as I was sitting in my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Be careful," "stay in well lit areas," "do not frustrate yourselves."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "" "" "and again the warnings:" "" "" "" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were believed to be Muslims and struck down.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this land attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have put the anger of the people on the terrorists." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumour is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be a few parking spaces, but not stopping terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as I recently told me a leader of the police in the Washington area, D.C. recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">During the radicalization process it has been found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from her church, even from her family, so that the extremist group can do brainwashing, which leads to the fact that the person thinks that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behavior and their ideology is a traitor or rejected by faith.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS bases its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, as the Ku Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"" "" "" "both groups claim their ideology in their" Holy Book "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="344">But when you take a look at them, it does not exaggerate what they read in their "Sacred Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality, which lets them read these things in the Scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister he spoke with was silenced and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense of her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia and my family were concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans work?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We tend to accept an authoritarian governmental system, conformity, and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study reveals that when people submit messages that were reported negative about Muslims, they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">When you see when the mood against Muslims crept up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two periods of election.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well-informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">When it comes to the allocation of collective debt, it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple living at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did I become such an accomplished young man from my brother?"</seg>
<seg id="375">Just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting the afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot on Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be fatal, not only immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or stayed at home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the child's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I took him out, drew my shoes, went to the hall, and what I saw let me stop." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assemblies were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think that we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you're holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, working in a noble think tank, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I'm completely normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at Muslims around the world, and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception tend to appear, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you so much. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air parcel delivery penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">Connecting units allows air devices to reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build resilient structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zürich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, calculate calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands are available on the highest level e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight machine that tries to beat two birds with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starter motors, it is efficient in advance flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starter motors it can float, and therefore has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit does not matter in what position the optimal position is recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">OK. OK.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be, for example, what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which join together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one thing works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest remotely operated flight machine. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, one propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and transverse rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, inside life very much happens so that it can fly steady and move in the room everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge-starters. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right in the right place is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the monospinner is an exercise in contentment, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in excess.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, he receives the extraordinary ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter what direction it rotates or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate twin propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When they are assembled, they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller comes off, the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly, if limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half of it flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration scrutinizes synthetic sponges.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We recorded commercial Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the wage in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes revolve around each other in a very far away galaxy, transforming the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second to pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was born on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced some things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us -- even the internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to look for gravitational-waves, which arise approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed her idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work, they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser-Interferometer gravitational-wave-observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to solve some minor, stubborn problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">In essence, these were the fruits of my life's work.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been examining gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observatories as ligo measurable signals.</seg>
<seg id="493">A wave of gravitation is a ruffling in the texture of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the shaft is pulled over, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and stowed in the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Instructors in courses on relativity theory often lead to a really silly dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On the 14th of September, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by us when hitting the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma followed by a 1. for this reason, one explained the Ligo staff crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than one thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Drove Kip Thorne, a co-founder Ligos, the hunt for the waves as follows: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength far smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can make a picture or map of things by perceiving the light coming around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">It's different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible, to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For your child's face, for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to connect to the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now, Alice" speaks.</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dumb Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave patterns into sound we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity, we can tell us about the collisions of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular easy: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies turn very quickly, you hear the same chirp with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender noise] Someone who knows what to listen to, recognizes this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circling around a hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">In this there is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo opens a completely new way to research the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on this path we can listen to the all and hear the invisible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practically or fundamentally -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereighty stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes occur in the nucleus, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own tail-light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in the universe that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as ligo observed them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, age-old bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the birth of the stars and ultimately, how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories - a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I experimented with an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "" "" "for a year I would say" "" "" "" "Yes!" "" "" "" "I was afraid of." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "" "" "no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" Yes "" "" "" "." "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak in public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply to an unexpected item. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "" "" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "" "" "pussy" "" "" "" "for inexplicable reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"pussy, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said, "Yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude towards life in my family. from then on, I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a startling side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" -say for playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm a writer. I think things look like, wake up to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television in a grand scale.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each stream offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days at four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts simultaneously: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run successively on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so above all. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still makes this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I say to you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I am not just around the computer and fantasies, and it is true when I say: I understand that it is not about dreaming in a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I step into the work, there is no other sense.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as if I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As if you make a high note, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could always drive on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people believe that when I explain to them the sums, I'm writing over writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the sums -- when I began working with television production when I began to work and work and to work, create, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The voice is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can't aspire differently to size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to aspire to size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Maybe it's the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know that I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this totem?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Reworked, overstressed, exaggerated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that her mother is a single working institution.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there, but you can write my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "" "" "and Emerson says:" "" "" "" "pussy, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzzing did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, elaborated weekends, no regrets, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all my heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">There was silence in me.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programmes, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-titanium,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no more fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly fading out the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "" "" "I know some may think:" "" "" "" "grasshopper, stupid author-titanium." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do it, you're doing what you're doing, being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "" "" "and then my" "" "" "" "southern states waitress" "" "" "" "asks me a question." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Mama, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no, when two things become clear to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "pussy."</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and my humming smokes, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "" "" "and so she says," "" "" "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "" "" "and I say," "" "" "" "Yes." "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it's outstanding because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and lack of summing, I can't do anything except to fit.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they do not exist any more.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl in "The Ice Queen" lets go.</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the buzzing, the titanium dioxide, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the help of shows and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the totem is not a force and it is not labour-specific." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't have to play as much as you work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is painful,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a man rather works than to be home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rode around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent, and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my mobile.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also do it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And I am talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes by play!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to go.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be children. it is important to feel the buzz, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">In order to "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Have a look at the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and save yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I'm winning. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" stands for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not treat yourself for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the buzz, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the totem, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my humming.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sum of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sum of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's me snip that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a titanium, the journey to Jerusalem is playing.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children are.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon which I run, the troops, the screens, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the other, the right sum: the buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this totum, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new attitude towards life is spreading within me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this totum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm a writer. I think things look like I'm getting you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>

<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to deal with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low self-healing ability.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted an electrode deeply in the brain in order to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">However, neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The neurosurgeon's dream is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with a skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain and increases the cranial pressure in the skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, it is necessary to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To let cells grow from one piece of tissue is comparable to very small children who are taken out of their families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to succeed.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, immature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were dispersed slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They account for 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of foetus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells in the same way as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we re-implemented them at the receiving point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we re-opened the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we caused an injury and re-reimplantated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained - they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motor skills area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it happened to humans, they spontaneously retreated to some degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, as is the case with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now that we re-reimplantated the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were exciting results for us as well.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "" "" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can need it. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials at humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, one has to fill approximately two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then it is necessary to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study.</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it's safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to regard them as immutable poetry.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and an impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy vanishes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally made clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs realised in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly said that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Euro Group succumb to a mistake, we could save ourselves from democracy, but that we need a true and defensive democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for without democracy our societies will gloat, our future gloomy and waste our great new technologies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste, I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the twin summit paradox.</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, who are too anxious to invest in where it would be productive and contribute to the production of the debt and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, such as "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth.</seg>
<seg id="922">3.4 trillion US dollars sounds like much money, until it compares it to the $5.1 trillion US dollar, which at the same time circulated in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing, except to inflate stock exchanges and boost the real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital are the twin peaks that are not mutually exclusive by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result are stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low general economic demand which, as in a final loop, promotes the pessimism of investors, who, out of fear, the prophecy of the bull might be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">His exceedingly wasteful kind. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents, and to finance especially all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">Of course, the Athenian democracy included too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the importance of the Athenian democracy on account of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive aspect of the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in questions of the state concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy hasn't lasted too long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that glows very brightly, it is burned out quickly.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present-day liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our democracies, since the time when this division of politics and economics began, a relentless struggle took place between the two, as the economy gradually subfiltrated and deprived them of politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why the politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because it can be in the government today and yet not in power, because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators that have so sustainably decimated the animals they feed on, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has harmed politics so far that it harms itself by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is increasing, political goods are being devalued, the inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism distributes the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to reassemble the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, aside from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position just as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts more deeply, just as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must restructure the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we are democratizing the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements which he produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," in which machines serve human beings and people put their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies: please imagine a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "then all revenues come from capital and from revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to enterprises, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not belonging to it. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no huge twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the area of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a freely wavering exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Suppose the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "Kosmos' -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the net income of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that these funds are investing in green technologies, especially in parts of the world in which investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunited policy and economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is simultaneously the secretary in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the trash bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we jointly decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do that, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls as "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant.</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm totally chaotic.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your speech you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's perspective on China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I can say this provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill -</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China is very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the nineteenth century, smells immensely in hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as Finance Ministers at the start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">That is to say goodbye to the complacency, and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the Eurozone, and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which by the way, was the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro Group, have continued to denounce denial." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to keep alive through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the change happens, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone does not have a future unless we change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BA: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, asserts that he has made no mistake then this is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extending the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions that were running through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "" "" "none of the troika creditors imposed on this policy said:" "" "" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone against comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my greatest fear is that the eurozone doesn't survive." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to embark on the path of a post-modern 1930 what it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Price, most of them have never heard even though he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy had three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is managing director at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "" "" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelhorn and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "" "" "movies, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy does not have any choice.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this rating is received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire," all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to sign "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the average expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and, through an evaluation, selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon releases things for nothing, one does not intervene correctly?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know that they are being watched when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are being watched by Roy and his team who pick up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, what parts you jump over or check again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">In fact, they collect the data, process it and this results in the answer, and this is: "Amazon should make a sitcom via four Republican US senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that many cannot remember this show because it wasn't that good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find this one super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have watched the available data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give to the shows, what shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they took a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">You have two very competitive, data seeded companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is the reason?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work out this way, it's a bit scary because we live in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail here in the United States and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. that's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that due to data analysis outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, they can predict -- by analyzing Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked fine, year by year around year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this once again was a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flow rapidly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-supported genetics -- an area where some very smart people inconceivable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years, I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the individual parts; as a second, put the individual parts together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and to understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to put the parts together again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For that there is another tool and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is to put parts and pieces together again even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds where they are also part of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show such as "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they took a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they vie for TV ideas when they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "" "" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "" "" "we are telling us the data." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-Question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely," right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it out later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">I have made a few decisions in my life so far, where I should have heard in hindsight on the ball.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, of course, as you know when you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a bit more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. ultimately it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, to be an expert in what one is doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
