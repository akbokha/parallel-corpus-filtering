Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Irish institution , where young people are to meet today .
a cryp@@ t where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the erst@@ while land of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , which had to be exciting because the Nav@@ i Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but up @-@ to @-@ date - yet therefore very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich Mer@@ cury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern at@@ las is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
detailed maps , so @-@ called pri@@ mor@@ dial papers , were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages .
these were created according to the data of the Bavarian Palace Department between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first surve@@ ying of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops mar@@ ched off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card .
Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph further promoted the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration .
the origin@@ ating sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all the others on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was established 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 18@@ 77 , as the Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present @-@ day Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written number of manus@@ cri@@ pts from the so @-@ called &quot; judgment &quot; from which the basic tax was deduc@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 the scene of the October festival , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the district of today &apos;s district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the hill &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people once locked people with ins@@ anity .
in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district asylum &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was developed .
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended the killing of so @-@ called Irish . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 seats .
at some point , this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ dez@@ v@@ ous in Hair 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ anism are now meeting in the area of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments .
the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich east is west , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built in architec@@ turally reminiscent of the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ te , which was destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks .
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; Main Square , &quot; the shopping street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre .
one big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business buildings and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days were the prepar@@ atory work and on April 5 , 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for F@@ itting Far@@ es issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and ra@@ cial attacks by the State .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls for Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention to travel by the State and take extreme care , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial @-@ based events l@@ ately exist in the entire state and mentioned here , &quot; it says in the Group &apos;s opinion .
a recently adopted Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the state &apos;s law enforcement agencies , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately aim at minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group cited incidents like ra@@ cial off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Police , without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Mis@@ sour@@ i Administr@@ ative Office &apos;s Office , showing that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are being stopped by 75 percent more frequently than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring in ch@@ ewing money or let relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States had adopted immigration laws that would obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for migration violations , which will contribute to further ra@@ cial profil@@ ing in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .
soft aun@@ ching project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Magic Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have provided a picture on the ground .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family court yard .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann gave us an insight into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; is for him the alternative market@@ able marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
region@@ als exclusively arrive at the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste dinner table .
since he is also a B@@ L@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the soft aun@@ ching project as &quot; elementary . &quot;
I cannot generate profit@@ ably on such steep surfaces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area care for a lot of work , a lot must be worked with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann stressed .
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not conduct a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the importance of the soft @-@ aun@@ ted project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the land could still be extended for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to carry on their farm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often under criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of openness is 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by Leader , a quarter carried the community of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus the farmers left 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; Schwen@@ de@@ mann explained .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and farmers . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Council Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state sponsor@@ ing of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to open the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveying backdrop marked by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be fenced must not be slu@@ gg@@ ish@@ able ( slope inclin@@ ation above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build a fence just under 16 kilometres is currently underway for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ lu@@ aun@@ ay Project 2018 .
the maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the most secure sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans cher@@ ish this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump ré@@ gi@@ me , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ im@@ it@@ ators would have retri@@ eved him if he had done so .
but he took on its importance , and in particular the meaning attributed to it , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added to its base .
when Miller &apos;s A@@ co@@ sta described , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
the poem you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your afflicted masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the el@@ event@@ ful waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller didn &apos;t engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America &apos;s significance .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she performed a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical representation .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the association of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the big scre@@ am R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo @-@ conserv@@ atism that brings the American flame to the re@@ thought world : &quot; Lady Liberty is advancing .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh encountered quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , poor but hop@@ eful people after long and often aw@@ ful travels on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
her statue talks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oses Scottish Members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Scot@@ s@@ men belonged to the team of Great Britain
the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics track record , N@@ eil Black says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your chapter of Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth world championship in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and last year saw five British and two European records set up .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games after a great season .
Do@@ yle rec@@ alls her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in the Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell team .
the team captain says that she is very proud of the fact that many of her coun@@ try@@ men are not only a team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my te@@ amm@@ ate voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots belonging to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on platforms .
what is my speech as a Captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiast@@ adion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critic@@ isms on Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you cannot tolerate the pre@@ heating of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad news .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he sli@@ pped in the cri@@ tique , secure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan to work on more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ end@@ ants it at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important when it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary ho@@ of head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum designated as official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or bun@@ tings or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the priest rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same issue , then they are considered by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s staff described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue was last week in Virginia .
the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last viol@@ ated the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it shouldn &apos;t be that hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter t@@ ach@@ ograph@@ ers en@@ acted upon his leadership .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhel@@ med his post , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field left to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he laid down this place .
he is an ard@@ ent advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels particularly true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura distinction as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories from last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one we will always treasure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home soil .
this event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am happy about how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer through passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 kinds of pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer deaths are due to passive smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
residential comple@@ xes prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; construction work in Vill@@ inger Straße is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the manager of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house @-@ connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as in the underground there is a lot of mountains , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly hin@@ dering the construction work , is a big problem for the construction company of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and shut@@ ters is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the troubled Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the chi@@ pped bulb is taken with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , for example to wash clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a space @-@ less space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , her fields were not assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around after 5@@ pm in the village , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was accepted in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote by a public raise in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as seclu@@ ded as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with around 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo h@@ edges , and made of corrugated sheets , which were transformed by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones .
very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and bright rock .
&quot; we used to have only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst children &apos;s mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has wood resources worth $ 78 billion .
these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid almost $ 20 million local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in one single officer .
Pap@@ ua &apos;s demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands were ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s ancest@@ or state in the 1970 &quot; s were committed to the genocide according to the Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Are All Neg@@ oti@@ ations &quot; is reported in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e in 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric sho@@ cks are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have increased since Pap@@ ua &apos;s resources produce an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants are from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to work in the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has ta@@ sted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ho@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the natives feel che@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted for Jok@@ wa@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai opened a low point only two months after the inauguration in October .
on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
one of the soldiers stum@@ bled upon their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their guns , telling victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so hard hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football ground in front of the local police station and the Military Command Center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial arch@@ ways and led the Wa@@ it@@ ita Dance - running in circles and im@@ it@@ ating a bird song - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated up , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official TI@@ ME document not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the im@@ pending danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ v was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is wearing only a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that their officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were being attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves when people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &quot; filtered &quot; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks later Jok@@ wa@@ i held a passionate talk in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he establishes a out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for expos@@ ing historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must undergo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to build a complaint in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , charged by the UN for crimes against humanity , called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with fi@@ erc@@ ely dis@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother , Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us , said that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the dead , the military searched for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building company who refused to hosp@@ itali@@ ze an unconscious man , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s bure@@ au .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing a warning shot .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly included here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden myself in my house for two days . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by inf@@ ecting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice being sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the crop for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to compete for their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , the chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal assembly .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
beyond that , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
beginning of the year French repor@@ ters Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Pap@@ ua because of lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ho@@ v &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report about Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ ua .
in March , six Pacific states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said to journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him . &quot; we want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ wa@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ho@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , the President of the tribal Council .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ wa@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot victims consisted of a last symbolic act of the de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give justice to them , but at least they will not forget their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a s@@ unk head . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch sky@@ scra@@ pers &apos; of Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential tower in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire , which in only two years swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; said a resident who named his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units extingu@@ ished the fire at 4 : 00 p.m. local time ( GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said they are working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage occurred from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates for isolation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the Annual General Meeting .
at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this Sport Revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the two @-@ thirds majority required by the two @-@ thirds majority .
although they often have very long , but also very much appreciated five @-@ set classic , the traditional competition is thus preserved .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of the member states voted for the reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore margin@@ ally missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change in order to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
it was not until the vote that , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal had already come before the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 are only comparatively minor details : in the future , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the following year in the first round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers are bringing prohibited items to the aircraft , finding out a pol@@ l
a survey among passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft , while inad@@ vert@@ ently bore knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent claimed they had delayed delayed by er@@ ron@@ eous guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted in more than 1,000 people , which was carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent were millenni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said they had know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many mistakenly sent s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .
it is no surprise that people who are know@@ ingly s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly most frequently .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which fluids they can take with them or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids that are conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA might look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k happily announces the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has previously under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the always trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k will reveal another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous number for the first time in announc@@ ing the latest quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k had often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre@@ orders for the new car whose ex@@ tradition has just begun .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ .000 reservations , 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn .
critics have always pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays 1000 Euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
currently 45@@ ,000 such un@@ binding reservations acc@@ ru@@ e , Mus@@ k admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .
his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 it is expected that all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 will be one million by 2020 .
the demand for it is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1,@@ 800 reservations are made every day .
those who order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may expect deliveries early in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interrup@@ tions with maximum utilisation .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if it comes to greater delays , then the non @-@ binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent un@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA Head P@@ ru@@ itt re@@ trac@@ ts due to the reluc@@ tance of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
a day after being su@@ ed by 15 states Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ pp presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous job in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is about a period exp@@ iring on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth Oz@@ on .
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would be delayed for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or ham@@ per@@ ing economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma before his appointment , was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been persu@@ aded to block or delay regulation that resist@@ s the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ pp regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , which oblig@@ ated oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt indicated that his revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply met the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often fails to comply with the dead@@ lines and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take fri@@ es seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and the authority we give us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opinion of the EPA however said that P@@ ru@@ pp will eventually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; power to delay and all other legally available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the O@@ zone rules .
a draft law approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
the New York general prosec@@ utor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states accused of the EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our law@@ suits - is an important benefit for the health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; Schneider said .
new York was in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont , Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year thousands of premature deaths will contribute .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists rejo@@ iced over P@@ ru@@ proposes surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing , how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , a seren@@ ade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday 16th July .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius Villa is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens a concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in documentary records : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church on Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard of Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , in addition to the former parish church , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a noble court to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age was owned and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village .
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ line these historical conditions .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , furnished and occupied with a pastor , still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church .
this was the right to appoint a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ at@@ est of the two de@@ bar@@ red at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortun@@ es , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the tower @-@ wer@@ g existing today remained as a witness to the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ ish are cultiv@@ ating the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen retired &quot; as success@@ ors to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
on Sunday 16th July , the Friends and Don@@ ors of Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
place leader Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
for the end of the seren@@ ade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest , &quot; the organizers set out the fantastic views .
the seren@@ ade is only held in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius @-@ system , which is of importance for tumours and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines prove
Bo@@ is@@ heim refused &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore turned to the coun@@ cil@@ or .
the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses . &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) has called on its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is un@@ lawful .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 there would be no wind turbines at all in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , as at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind force concentration zone in Vier@@ sen at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone is an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent a &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; of the landscape .
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had approved a second wind power conc@@ entri@@ c zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette by a change in the land use plan - but they had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning permission , the granted approval decision remains un@@ lawful and therefore also to take back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state of affairs : before the summer break the coun@@ cill@@ or once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out according to plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the letter has been received by Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
however , they are unlikely to cause the procedure to be stopped .
with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the arguments of the Bo@@ is@@ heim association .
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans the construction of four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town Vier@@ sen was involved indirectly , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hectare estate .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW level plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the car and tractor crash together : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; woman dies with terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the shopping spre@@ e into the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers , which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket product .
thus , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their apprentices@@ hips .
in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
in doing so , the campaign aims not only for residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed p@@ ou@@ ches pointing out on the promotional weekend , so Christian König .
the municipal administration and business association co@@ operates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the commercial association and the city are entering a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot;
this includes new offerings , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ fest with sal@@ ted Sunday , talks with all trades and hosts , in order to make them active participation .
attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened again .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the city centre when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ating the city centre - to land@@ lords , the businesses of the whole city and associations .
it was a matter of overcoming the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had spread to some extent , as king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , informed that five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities take part in the third &quot; home shopping &quot; day nationwide .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and emphas@@ ise its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners makes it clear that every citizen can have a direct influence on his / her purchasing behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
during construction , a gas explosion took place in the school building .
new more people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people have been killed and nine others have been injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) there was a l@@ ately in critical condition .
a person died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first missing was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
as a matter of fact , the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building for the holiday .
tr@@ ump translated after le@@ aked contacts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Chief of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump invited En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ten@@ se replacement .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; dum@@ my &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade made by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;

&quot; get him out of your car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
luckily , this horri@@ ble scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post .
but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; almost all of the people in the audience clas@@ hed with real si@@ ghs .
since 2005 , civil rights activists come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were retri@@ eved by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever indic@@ ted for murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post @-@ order . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil right .
for him , the pos@@ ing serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that a injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to stop , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on July 27 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com struck a white landed propriet@@ or , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore came not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , such as the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison , who prepared and arranged the kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; conclu@@ des an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in mur@@ ders , removing evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a suff@@ rage massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual install@@ ment of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her presentation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of whom wish to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even harder to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with his ug@@ liness in us all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chef @-@ C@@ lan@@ co for years , but he said the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I am not like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to go back to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester stra@@ ys and har@@ ms him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --- He , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ cona respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene , always smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , one of the
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; R. &quot; .
and precisely there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with emphasis .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
a woman clothed with a sad@@ ness is above the dead bodies of the actors and introduces Bil@@ lie Holidays as a mo@@ ck@@ ery speech &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen viewers caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the road .
they have experienced sho@@ cking hydr@@ ation for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song end , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the cor@@ p@@ se .
children sit at their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene would like to thank the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope away and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have done it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience together with the actors sat down for dinner .
at one table , a white pair of Atlan@@ ta talks about the night position with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was fighting to find words which felt the performance left behind .
&quot; it is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ch is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks cl@@ ut@@ ches court at his table , for@@ gets and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he already started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the post is inspired in a way , for it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a giant , six @-@ stor@@ eyed setting .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows an optionally sk@@ ul@@ led street corner including Mauer@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ sta &quot; logo from the G@@ DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ mort@@ als pose as Rock@@ fruitful , or alternatively an Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that runs through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhine dre@@ d@@ men - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - are in harmony with the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; project .
ess Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , they rent a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ gel@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the wonderfully nasty Ha@@ gen surrounding the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ weight box@@ ers .
brut@@ ally the scene when he created Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it later .
the audience thanks the ensemble with a strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ duc@@ tor Jan@@ owski are celebrated in a stor@@ my way , who hum@@ bly bends her hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat in casual clothing .
the performance was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team .
in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ellen@@ istic pipe concert about himself , and five years later there were great rejo@@ icing in which the scattered &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; calls went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced over this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you notice that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with cast@@ or , but also an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive summary .
Max Quanti@@ ty works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their voluntary year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in a single belt at the furniture fair , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
you are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does that come about ?
Q : I did a high school high school .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , abor@@ ted successfully .
I know for myself that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
take a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focus maybe also , really .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social life in the winter semester .
I &apos;m going to study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker education and studying in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er Service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where you are doing his FS@@ J .
you can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
I was partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon supervision .
for me , that was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
in a different way than in civil engineering studies ?
a lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating the st@@ atics .
there are always other people in front of each other , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been taken out of the family - one always has to deal individually with it .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
a lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
a lot of love , a lot of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is that way .
Pear@@ son cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , which the CEO John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , will in addition to its previous restructuring , where 4,000 points have already been lost .
in May , Pear@@ son announced a third cost reduction program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( $ 3@@ 94 million ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its shar@@ ehol@@ ding to Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House at the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO military and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and informed NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians were killed during the incident in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by an impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ts@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby b@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops crushed the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump ass@@ esses the number of U.S. troops that support the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani in recent weeks .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , which states that States are obliged to cur@@ b the emissions @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone regulation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it is the agency &apos;s obligation to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and on responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA manager Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone conditions in which pollut@@ ant emissions must be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the District of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump is supposed to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the back@@ lash of democr@@ ats and conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EP@@ O website says that inhal@@ ing air , containing o@@ zone , can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms , such as asthma , for example .
municipal council aims to create community space
in the end , the decision was clear : at two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of flu@@ i@@ mand@@ ates decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
there is important information before the discussion : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is still in the community , but there is now no planning permission for the project to be st@@ em@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the municipal council lev@@ it@@ ates that such a common room is not intended as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the sen@@ iors @-@ just housing , but openly into the community .
as an example , the word &quot; kn@@ itting cafe &quot; made the round .
the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current household last autumn , will be made possible by funding opportunities .
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a common space would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , capable of supporting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this regard it is not possible to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , the conclusion that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the ambient conditions - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height of the tr@@ uss and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ o means this addition .
if it helps : unanim@@ ously , it passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy to walk in the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one does not get so much forward , so they lean at the common room out of the window , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against communal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of already wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area , one does not give a subsi@@ dy , but I get a real equivalent in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ge@@ ers &apos; motion to split the resolution accordingly will find three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program that says Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we sum up the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ st@@ ened , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg , coming from the direction of Hil@@ den on the way .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road , he obviously did not notice the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car which headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown into the street .

the Super Cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel @-@ care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first obligatory match of the new season .
seven pro@@ s are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the staff at the German soccer team Bayern München are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
in addition , the mou@@ th@@ pieces of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and the missing balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights casts a spell over the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
hiking in the resin from star to star
in the Harz region , the first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created .
the association is planning the observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star@@ path &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ ards , called it .
he connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the organisation plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the boards should be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ path , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association explained .
in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more luminous than another , although it lies much further away .
I will also tell in which con@@ stellation a selected star differs and when to see it best .
the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the small town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy become visible with the naked eye .
since 2003 , in the university town , there has been something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail - the Plan@@ etary Trail - on the initiative of the Göttingen funding association Planet@@ arium .
starting with Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( congregation Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the plan@@ ks with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to at the end point degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and the scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 @-@ metre @-@ distant sun is measuring 70 centimet@@ ers .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were supposed to face a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super Spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
as the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; but I am not so great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he has to move on weight @-@ weight @-@ weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demands the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this struggle . &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light @-@ weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later openly expressed his willingness to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he gu@@ essed Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday struggle .
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko stopped with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
both said they could sense the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be done . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four last moves to a tyre plate
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the on@@ set of the market at 16.@@ 30 hrs shortly before the market width .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the for@@ gery , where it over@@ came and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction north for about an hour , followed by the traffic on the left lane along the accident site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ cycle works better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after 2 : 2 and@@ re Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Brun@@ swi@@ ck that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
with the first round of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result , if not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to pay much better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf .
in the Or@@ e Mountains the tri@@ cycle is to be optimized even further .
and a gate after a kick won &apos;t catch sight of the for@@ ts either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one else will focus on the line next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the three @-@ chain preparation than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t even know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the three @-@ chain half@@ way positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Cast@@ le@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not afford so many ab@@ duc@@ tions in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
naturally , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can speak after a draw from a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I don &apos;t judge the start of the season only after six to eight days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who did not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled pre@@ mat@@ urely because of a storm .
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fresh , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an Ascension favorite in the bones .
&quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they are at the moment , &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland become an easier favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away only because we have the right to get among the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ lig@@ a , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; says For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application assessment published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have under@@ gone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Authority ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases , and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has published the results from a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31st July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; might be under 18 years old . &quot;
the tests are carried out only in cases in which the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the En@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the app@@ rais@@ al of biological maturity of people to see if they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ass@@ essing biological age in this way is very un@@ safe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg proceeds well .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport at the District Executive Committee Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , work began at the same time on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is maintained .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a rain@@ bow bridge made of concrete coated with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now been preserved on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a side fixing that is also used as a working path .
a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about this is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .
special finger tips have required laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable that many companies are connected to .
the local residents were informed about the project in the run @-@ up to the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished first .
for the bridges between the farm buildings and the collection pond in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the cost of the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colourful protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ sau Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day is peac@@ efully flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster .
and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are already on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ voters but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
originally , the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; is planned on the well square , but now takes place on the parking under the rear seat - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that offers itself .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A World and one of the great organizers , is really happy : &quot; it &apos;s great how many people came together here . &quot;
there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; age @-@ German potato salad , &quot; which the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along .
the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence in front of the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there weren &apos;t enough parking spaces due to the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen .
so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
with a view of the event on the rear square he says : &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
this is also the case : around 8@@ pm a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various or@@ ators , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall are about 200 people waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to keep their speeches .
the police presence remains unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour the Af@@ D event takes place , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 9@@ pm .
the police can shift - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher tro@@ mb@@ on@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ mari@@ zed tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have scored sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in European high @-@ level orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov solo@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the solo@@ ist at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to transc@@ end the borders of their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall art work .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is very open about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually dealt with bitter@@ ly .
despite all this , the bri@@ tish act@@ ress affir@@ ms the Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &apos;s magazine : &quot; I have seriously fallen in love with whom I have been doing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;ve played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her separation , Kri@@ sten claimed that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism .
so I have never confused or hin@@ der me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never really liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show bi@@ z , &quot; but in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls .
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public does not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to relate to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the Party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you many prayers and a lot of thinking ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I &apos;m a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement at West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal store by his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the National Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party which would rather prevent us from working on our country again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , ein@@ i@@ ding message , &quot; said R@@ NC Chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he reiter@@ ated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russian athle@@ tics CEO D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin spoke during the IA@@ AF meeting on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes who have been caught in gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed on the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised with itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress was made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re@@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next few months we have to do everything to normal@@ ise this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia needs to meet some of the criteria for re @-@ recruitment .
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral ceremony for soldiers cut off in Mali
at a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ ky in northern H@@ esse , around 1000 people of the two soldiers who were killed in a helicopter crash in Mali had thought .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
Secretary of Defense , Ur@@ sul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing about the un@@ resolved down@@ fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two in@@ verse pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cor@@ onation of their expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have done in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead @-@ guard of the Bundes@@ wehr in the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the relatives of the church took leave .
afterwards the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
this included H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and general inspec@@ tor Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
there were ro@@ ses on the grapes , the relatives were arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ s and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sh@@ attered .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight @-@ operation of the fighter @-@ helicopter Tiger in F@@ ritz@@ ky and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also Volker Bau ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no doubt about the UN mission in Mali by the minister of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no tomb next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
the Danish King &apos;s Cou@@ ple is traditionally buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already manufactured a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to keep her informed .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to be king .
in 2016 he retired and also sets up the title &quot; princ@@ esses &quot; at the same time .
because Hen@@ rik had not received the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after his death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the principal speaker of the Danish King &apos;s House .
where the last resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bl@@ eman , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy .
during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es during his almost 50 @-@ year reign .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ ken stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises that I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of social critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants prompt new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because on Friday , the resolution of the Parliament spoke out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
earlier , the surprising departure of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties from their State Parliament faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
El@@ ke T@@ ester , former member of the Green Party , founded her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants his group to welcome her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be voted on the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ urg@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could further go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
for Stephan Wei@@ l , however , it is essential for the Land@@ tag to quickly resolve its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible .
the CD@@ U group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament &apos;s parliament draws the confidence and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be legally insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ urg@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss in quiet@@ ness all the questions if they are legally reasonable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ urg@@ ler called &quot; T@@ west &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apost@@ ate de@@ pu@@ ties to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we , of course , assume that she has returned to her country trade , which she has received through the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the pres@@ idents Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no substan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Low @-@ Sax@@ on Green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ ester to CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conduct of former Gre@@ ens Members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly re @-@ elect the parliament .
the Australia exit costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her desp@@ ised vanity and fru@@ stration with her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has taken this dirty tri@@ ck@@ le and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ urg@@ ler is pleased to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ ester in the CD@@ U .
the SPD leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ westen there , with personal career gifts , distor@@ ting the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election .
at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest force in the SPD and the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of a vote in the parliament .
interview - How do we protect ourselves from po@@ isons , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany is discussing poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal be ?
how can consumers safeguard themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to view the eggs in your refrigerator accurately and check the stamp printing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the Länder provide the latest information on the concerned egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
also , if after all that we currently know , a health hazard is practically impossible .
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
in spite of this , my house has stopped immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of the concerns of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has as well as manufacturers ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ loaded eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
according to the state of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must expect economic damage because of the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always there is too little control in the case of emer@@ gen@@ cies .
is it missing only on the staff or also on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosec@@ uting counsel in cases where crimes can be given are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made clear several times that I expect incomplete clari@@ fication by the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ nis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to get only safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ authorised insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , retailers and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
basically it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supplying animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are dealt with swiftly and comprehen@@ sively . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed spending on European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in the face of the financing of the team by the energy @-@ rich family of the Q@@ at@@ ari host family .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must interact with legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break @-@ even point in their activities related to football .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election as the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and cra@@ cked to ruin , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue .
during the current three @-@ year investment period that runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million .
and despite the fact that Plat@@ ini fell into favour in 2015 by the Pres@@ idency , his successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to frigh@@ ten excessive expenses .
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the revenues for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ship was to exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be considered a legitimate income .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was boo@@ sted by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come to Qatar about payments made by the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will be ambassador and a such maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could easily be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros , generated a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published .
PS@@ G anticip@@ ates that N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot@@ ine sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said President of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar &apos;s last owner of PS@@ G .
Ar@@ senal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or may have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new company supplier
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has made board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end : the airline is rel@@ aun@@ ching its mission .
on request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss @-@ speaking Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; of Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packaged beauty tablets up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately CHF 1 billion .
but more important is the advertising effect : for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious assignment .
Swiss will not be able to reveal how many candidates there is for the new invitation to tender .
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
according to the newspaper report Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract in spring 2018 .
for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement .
chocolate tablets have been distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
before Swiss Life concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss opted for the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline co@@ operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long haul flights , the First Class customers are spoiled with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class the passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i von Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class , distri@@ butes on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge period ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time would be short .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking can vegetable spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by getting into the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his grown @-@ ups , which now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to the watering can principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The hand that cap@@ tures the cra@@ dle &quot; ) .
at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ malign@@ ant plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ sung impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ ill@@ ons Under@@ li@@ ppen@@ bart of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of random ins@@ anity that could heat up this fran@@ chise , like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I believe as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose final scene will show the band premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt can be synchron@@ ised in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
with six long episodes it pul@@ ls away , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ arranged to a lesser length could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make everything a food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police had a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz ha@@ st@@ ened on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , officials provided greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
in the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian agents were involved in the action .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since summer 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany .
between the prosecution in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Red@@ t@@ weil were close to daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
that is why the large @-@ scale assignment was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
the investigation focused primarily on Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
fashion acc@@ uses large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; citizens who should not appear there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register holds significant short@@ com@@ ings in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in cases of asylum and deport@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to data , there are , according to data , ten million people with foreign nationality , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data are therefore managed by approximately 600 ali@@ ens polic@@ ing agencies in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently cared for , data quality in parts has not been good so far .
in some cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can significantly slow back processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of people who are sufficiently paid , EU citizens are also gr@@ asp@@ ed , who wouldn &apos;t have to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such false orders , however , led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; distorted debate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealing with ex@@ posit@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there .
this goes forth from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
in the paper it is said that BA@@ MF leads such methods &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper with reference to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state which they first reach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can return it to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send back refugees there as part of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human rights un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best earnings achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least among the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
all ahead of Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now distributed 50 litres of blood with its 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is awesome how our bodies are laid out for it , and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available for foreigners , &quot; under@@ lined by Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Prepar@@ ation Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preserved foods are broken down into their components .
three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K District Manager .
apparently the change into the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berries were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 don@@ or donated blood donations .
half past Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter left 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice each 500 milli@@ liters .
Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened the spec@@ ulation on a rise .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthening pressure .
the Bank &apos;s policy makers in the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in this month to increase , as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 , and warned that pressure on household income would continue to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the coming years , interest increases would be necessary to re@@ strain the inflation raised by the Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the cost of credit might have to rise to more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the M@@ amm@@ ut business stimulus package that was issued one year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks as of next February , although it was said that it is now expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households will continue to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the interest rates it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets expect .
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .
however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forec@@ asted growth forecasts for this year and next year are expected to be 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to those expected in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change will come after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of a rate increase and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover after the end of the year .
the latest inflation forecast offered little enthusiasm for households to be affected by rising inflation and minor increases in wages , as the tigh@@ tening process is getting worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will recover &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which is compensated by a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the sin@@ king of the pound . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate rose rose as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers in July demanded an increase of 0.5 % .
the inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whole &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking lou@@ dly for businesses and want to end the year in a positive manner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) aims to prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against funding the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered by the Health Service via a first three @-@ year study for an estimated 10,000 people .
he ple@@ dged to finance the trial after the Supreme Court uph@@ eld a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an important new intervention , while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p @-@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means taking just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable candidates are identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled through anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in overcoming one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Ter@@ r@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Minister of Health , said : &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government .
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
it is now important that this study will be carried out across the country as quickly as possible in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to a step closer to the end of the dis@@ semination of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne said .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous sla@@ b height optimally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the problem .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored in order to let it work for longer .
in the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some engineering art went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important , so if you push the door up@@ side down , it is very easy to gli@@ de . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
here , they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high @-@ quality materials , which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something really amazing in something .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in an argument about one of the largest real estate empire Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer college , Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis , lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court in order to explain how to divide their property and business .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family founded je@@ ans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , Brun@@ swi@@ ck &apos;s development areas and Sor@@ ren@@ to , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .
according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - owns about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owns 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth $ 176 million .
the allocation of real estate and cash has proven to be problematic for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations .
the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded it .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but prov@@ okes Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage prescri@@ bes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to purchase Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans@@ ry of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began in West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis Group , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both Lukas and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very shy , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; because the case was before the courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current stri@@ fe , &quot; he said and added that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kel@@ ly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new head of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course .
here is a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kel@@ ly , the new Head of Staff of the White House , met with executive employees on his first day of work , he presented a major issue to President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information which fell into the hands of the President .
Kel@@ ly told the cow@@ or@@ kers that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by supervis@@ ing his media diet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps &quot; relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a candidate was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaig@@ ners , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying price . &quot;
OK . OK .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about twe@@ ets that have not sent Tr@@ ump .
if his staff managed it several times to keep his anger away from him , then their efforts have paid off .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump Control controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that perhaps promotes their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - fully occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with embarrass@@ ing le@@ aks , and that he gets to see where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly that happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the President a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; being the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the White House General Secretary , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work and receive the pump . &quot;
how did that work out ?
Kel@@ ly tried three months later to do the same thing .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive Self , and his counsel@@ ors still strive for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population is requested and hoped .
the police all over Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals on the run .
as the addresses of the most sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known , references from the population are hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol on Friday reported on the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Christmas calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many transi@@ ent fle@@ es hide from holiday destinations , called it on the part of Euro@@ pol .
21 post@@ cards for searched eb@@ re@@ akers from 21 EU countries have been put together .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ .@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times it was viewed .
36 of the online requests could have been arrested , at least eleven of them due to signs following the publication on the website .
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords in the West Mid@@ lands are once again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war who negotiated a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to rec@@ la@@ im a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch dug out by the council to prevent their accidents .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have forced the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley &apos;s He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be compelled by shame to implement it , since it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved on and are back now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more came last night , probably today more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local charge if the Council cannot stop this . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to support our collection , it is very important that as many local residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling on 101 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
forest hotel Lu@@ ise is made of Birken@@ hof
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise will be from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ t is currently being renovated and is to be re@@ opened on the 1st of March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof hotels by the then ambience of operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatic escal@@ ating figures of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective housing , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers by establishing a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel site .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested parties in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ amo , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to bring it back to a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ amo and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Forest Hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is undertaken .
the floors were torn out , ceilings partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sch@@ erer says in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment .
it doesn &apos;t want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer points out .
the forest hotel Lu@@ ise , with about 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , Sch@@ erer .
the idea of the city was similar to that of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly according to the amount of investment .
just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee recorded the work over the past few weeks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the station CN@@ N reported there were already first sub@@ po@@ enas of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time being specifically interfer@@ ed with in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation focused on several men acting as an advisor to the Republi@@ cans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special Inter@@ medi@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally interven@@ ed in the centre and asked the accus@@ ation whether the president may have obstruc@@ ted the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge an indictment .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called ank@@ ee chambers .
they are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the committee can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to discharge persons to the company under oath .
according to CN@@ N , charges have already been issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify that it was said in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ um@@ ps also became consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the implementation shows that Mu@@ eller doesn &apos;t want to in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the rise of an indictment .
however , the enforcement of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue give the Democrats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I will not be determined against the President . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have no reason to accept that something has changed , it continued to be explained in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ration@@ ale , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have become lou@@ dly , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June , Com@@ ey told a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to release .
unlike an independent special agent of the congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later res@@ ig@@ ned president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice .
but several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft bills on Thursday , after which the special issu@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg drives Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the Western Antar@@ ctic a giant ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin was solved by the Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ l .
this was shared by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion ton and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until it melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the biggest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
it is not a danger to human beings .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in the rup@@ ture of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
however , for some 30 years , however , there has been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard .
Sch@@ el@@ ven &apos;s swimming pool is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this archipelago , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard there .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece is broken at a key .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and disp@@ ose ice as much water as it results after the melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly raise sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard is the fourth @-@ largest aw@@ ning of the Antar@@ ctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ ard will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man added and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers do not lead to the break@@ age of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg not on climate change , many glaci@@ al tu@@ ffs of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been dis@@ car@@ ded in recent decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
according to the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus number the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest .
CD@@ U wants a house @-@ ari@@ f at the staff
because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant places , the CD@@ U calls for the employers &quot; association to come out to become more attractive .
just shortly before the summer break , 41 new jobs were en@@ forced in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have their first day of work .
the teachers of the circle are apparently very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were reported for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
there are currently 50 un@@ occupied places in the M@@ ett@@ mann circle .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG in order to oppose the shortage of skilled labour in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the parties &quot; desire . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the objective is to meet not only short @-@ term needs at specialists , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage .
the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross @-@ country clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one previously did not know .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech is about a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contest of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .
so it is high time to act so that not even more positions remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the joint application with his party .
he had already taken care of a bad surprise already in the day of the circle , when he publicly called out the personnel costs cap and start@@ led the other parties .
people want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable an exit from the communal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration should strive with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ related cities - a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the collective bar@@ gaining for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are at present exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO migrants &quot; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German aid organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ re@@ ats &apos; because their crew effectively worked together with human traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express itself at the detailed alleg@@ ations of Amb@@ ro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio &apos;s Italian prosec@@ utor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations raised at the moment after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat &apos; Youth Ret@@ re@@ ats &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that his crew receives din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of carrying away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring about &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations .
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize winner organization is Mé@@ dec@@ ins sans Fron@@ ti@@ ères ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti , meanwhile , said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had gone back in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors bore fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin Ou@@ ter Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy the Tri@@ als and Si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days .
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome addition .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
viewing points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far over the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the front @-@ camped .
in between there were again and again long asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als reward .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the national festival saus@@ age market .
again there was an observation point at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and lod@@ ges brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
also Neu@@ stadt was controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group got to know the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tive and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ lig@@ a prepares for e @-@ sport
will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium ra@@ mps in the wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included .
these have also recognised the first federal li@@ ais@@ ons , who are increasingly engaged in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to inspire entirely new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are many clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen in the meantime advises one agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ an embassy to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation game are challenged at competitive level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gens have long established themselves , in which the professionals compete against each other .
e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme at the 2022 Games in Asia .
but is it a real sport at all ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bie has long dealt with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
cognitive skills , technical and tac@@ tical understanding and quick responsi@@ veness are required .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high inclusive effect of E @-@ Sports .
players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to reach 130 million .
this is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a .
however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ers .
many countries are already international .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez join the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood Ac@@ tor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe some things are happening .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as an instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ bie .
according to D@@ utt , the first @-@ league football associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ged behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing old times is no longer enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; meaning D@@ utt .
&quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays the same with football as it always was . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts that Con@@ rad Roy dare to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June because of negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is in@@ con@@ sol@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free of his vocation .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards , when she was sentenced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; your actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has no responsibility , &quot; she said .
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said that it is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they depl@@ ore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , stating that there is &quot; no day in which I do not smoke the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , to be there for his sisters , &quot; it says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persec@@ ute &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an a@@ unt to his children . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not having this single person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang on , spring from a building , get up for yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she told in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz declared that Car@@ ter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from any press of the case .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in 2007 because of murder of her British resident in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ i : learning from the new Mini L@@ ah@@ m of the FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua had allowed me to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is not a coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern looks after the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not hurt .
something else was different in his place in the cabin , which looked Joshua Kim@@ i immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made the ties that he had allocated to him .
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern captain .
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach Kim@@ i could interpret like this .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , composed of young players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from holidays .
sugar is preferably distributed to those of whom you have a lot of trust , which you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who have been chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ i confirmed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old te@@ amed over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right at the back , this is his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting formation like the one who can best take the helm in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ upe .
he had a view for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
Vi@@ dal not to over@@ play his missing fitness ( didn &apos;t work ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus decided to join the devil on the achievements of the Asia trip ( also worked only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not fall down neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ sto@@ cked Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le was also successful in the construction of the game a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he too showed a good performance when he made his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this style I was also brought up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the new entran@@ ts , one saw in the connection to the game .

David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bayern Legi@@ on@@ ary is a club colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B captain Schn@@ a@@ der@@ beck and with our frei@@ ghters .
the tweet of the Austrian Cup of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation .
the famous Bavarian Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft pra@@ ises Wis@@ sem@@ an
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on the T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy that has been blocking Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest revers@@ al point sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is set to stand construction law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West Bank of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
the goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says the spokesperson Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees this as a guide to supporting regional , but internationally competitive firms .
the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( I@@ HK ) ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( I@@ HK ) aims to stimulate the sales of a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Label in wine markets in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports falling for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euros is fores@@ een for the passing master examination and 2500 euros if graduates do themselves independently within ten years of the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
according to Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce , said that the road construction was planned quickly .
from 56 new engineers who want to stop Wis@@ sing at the regional company Mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied .
the Chamber of Commerce is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U vice @-@ president , refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018 , less in receipt of country roads than suggested .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a country &apos;s concept of how to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
the current broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 regional companies only evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK questionnaire with grade 3.4 .
they compl@@ ained about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind farm company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she had already cleared the field because of in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies .
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW chairman said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the enterprises described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered to be carcin@@ o@@ gens , and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install facilities to neutr@@ alize the exhaust gases ej@@ ected from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dra@@ gging the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ posit@@ ors that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but drive back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were charged , others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar

on Saturday again , if you go to the Is@@ ar , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building reference wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ otran@@ sav@@ ant .

Mor@@ dil@@ los no@@ d@@ ules and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was at times one of the most published carto@@ on@@ ists , the no@@ stri@@ ls of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still draws and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ ill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he was an artist for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his statements , he is still in the drawing table , working every day for nearly ten hours .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his cute figures continue to find much dis@@ semination worldwide .
for six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thous@@ and@@ rel as a counterpart .
for the first time his figures in the 3D movie , which should be projected onto the screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
this is why he tends to rely on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases that transmit diseases , which causes great head@@ aches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions .
Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rainf@@ all in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ ars with a large number of flowers , we have under@@ developed smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thur@@ in@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1,@@ 200 year anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist emphas@@ ises the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ce@@ as@@ eless drugs wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists talk about what is safer : they want to bring their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades , or leave them at home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach feelings reach .
there are drug traffi@@ ckers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the wage list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and as the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ sia , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ za building . two repor@@ ters in the 19@@ 30s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mar@@ es , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders committed every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the kill@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial .
at Ri@@ odo@@ sia , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tra@@ it@@ or .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we di@@ str@@ ust everybody . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ za in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks until his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times hit him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth Flow . &quot;
the sho@@ oter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day one or more people are shot on the street or that the Grav@@ eyard is full of decorated two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ za , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gan@@ gli@@ ons bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
in 2003 he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ sia with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
over time , the paper earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ za , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in prosec@@ uting Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he willingly admitted that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what went on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ sia team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ umptions about how they best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
to trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ sia in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class district of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ sia has li@@ cked on three main stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was assass@@ ination of the brother of the former known speaker Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é of state expenditure , concentr@@ ating on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a souvenir sheet removed from the office of the prosec@@ utor .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who ruled over all political levels almost all the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Ch@@ apo &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez presented Val@@ dez as the most informed source of ab@@ duction .
&quot; in the past we had known what has happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body .
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the staff became something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez gra@@ b@@ bed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador N@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
throughout the country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
this day , the director , Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities , sp@@ ying journalists and letting them kill , because they told the truth .
since then , she has asked her to be re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and in@@ different society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .
last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials .
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; here I am for my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the murder of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do what El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly re@@ port@@ edly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their homeland or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted like the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky choices .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that drug traffi@@ cking was frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement in front of the office and d@@ rank beer , when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ u@@ als and security forces near the resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate , as promised by a series of Kartell em@@ bas@@ sies in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the web site of Ri@@ odo@@ za via cell phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ap nearby - another shot in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers , keeping watch to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ sia followed his tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you remember &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when on the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible Rhin@@ o of a Canadian min@@ ers have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period from between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has ba@@ ff@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy crude oil .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a confrontation , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed us to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rs has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the exempl@@ ar allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or about his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread method of defence in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ shade is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds those of today living animals .
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution was fav@@ oring the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this natur@@ al@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r shows how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r pre@@ dat@@ ors have been to the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to explore the animal on information about his life , including his con@@ served intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ anz@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ mi@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he gru@@ b on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine , near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the sub@@ stituted din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were washed by western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater world of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin rem@@ n@@ ants still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning in the lot@@ tery .
the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can count the scales on his sole . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 motorway : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long st@@ aves - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , around 5@@ pm stood between the junction boxes Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another .
at first no information was given about the exact number of injured .
it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokesperson .
a large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a circular was formed around ten kilometres long .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , it was also on the tra@@ m@@ way to massive han@@ di@@ caps - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade was the hall@@ mark of vehicle anch@@ ors , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 motorway , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : there is no ins@@ ane sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paper@@ less ticket inspection .
one simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thereby evalu@@ ates the ticket .
currently , a test run runs on two tracks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer comes up , we will expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available on many other long haul routes in Germany early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the ticket de@@ valuation without conductor .
in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
you also have to buy the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one gets into the train , calls his ticket to &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
the test customers will then receive a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seating position Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives in place Y at ticket inspection , he knows that a passenger sits there with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , keep working , keep silent .
the check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should take advantage of passengers .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check their own in the DB Navigator .
this allows passengers to make their journey more personal on the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s Marketing Executive Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents needed to de@@ grade online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to present .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the compartment or greater room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to answer the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shocked to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b flat in St. Louis that she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled across a post from someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah has constantly been res@@ cu@@ ed on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the territory of St. Louis was about to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and remained there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her cell phone off to go back to twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman shared his gun and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cin@@ emas from the 11th century .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people living in community and filling the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had inn@@ um@@ erable times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she rec@@ alled what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 year old boy who wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organisation , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape in Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , she was the president of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it all happened . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors during an evening demonstration .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her camera man Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question came about Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community benef@@ iting from their pain and resistance .
as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around death tra@@ kt .
his engagement brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns was shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that it is &quot; not a Messiah &quot; leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life show how she falls in love with her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the person@@ alization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the movie &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ al type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film on account of its identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is no coinci@@ dence even though she was at the forefront because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can sense your energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
yet she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went to the street three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV @-@ readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though it hasn &apos;t been built for a long time yet .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct has split the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
there is hardly any cold on the subject .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the Bit @-@ Gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; This would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the start of the construction work , this will be the end .
the gallery makers want to integrate a Mark@@ thalle into the new building - at the Bed@@ a place with the opportunity to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years now .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women again and again very gladly .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery , depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low for the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops no longer exist and what is left of it will probably also disappear . &quot;
wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the peasant market stand during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in actually .
or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery manage to distribute all business from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
and no @-@ one needs a shopping centre that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg do not have space anymore .
once the farmer &apos;s market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ etz , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence , after she publicly posted diplomatic messages about Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is named A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ kins and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by man@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , such as someone with this gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though some intellectual commentary not only for the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also of identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already talked openly about the identification as a woman since she was pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use were too un@@ equal letters , which over the course of two years exchanged several letters .
they even created an illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform Chelsea judgment and it would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years would demand in a military jail in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump is w@@ aging a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ aring up the rigid divisions that it should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing demanded with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is endow@@ ed with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , of which gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome will not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also visible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the comic nov@@ els mentioned above .
it shows man@@ ing how to come up with a hands @-@ free phone in the hands of the United States discipline racks like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; never stop your mouth . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as predicted in the comic book - but if she should do so , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ons , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder
a nation @-@ wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Cook County &apos;s Local Court .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the spot , and det@@ ectives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said .
since 2007 , La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ unker , Vice President for University Relations , said in an email statement that La@@ them should now be assessed and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
a Spe@@ aker of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly ur@@ ges the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , which said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that loading and war@@ ts were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation of the occup@@ ants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister , Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM ann@@ ot@@ ated the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ introducing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added .
however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study granted by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We conduct the investigation , as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ os &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
speaking with the Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v launched problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one intends to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal by WA@@ DA .
however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di now sells eggs no more
this divided the company groups .
it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could be further assumed by no health impairment , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs are to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice .

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little help or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Er@@ res@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , staff anonym@@ ity and complaints management lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nu@@ is@@ ance in which those who have spoken have been punished .
this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
over a short time , u@@ ber has registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent can send customized &quot; Pul@@ se &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the Chief Executive Officer is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
when a company finds its employees badly treated or un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Con@@ ver@@ cent has deployed for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff .
now , as the company Con@@ ver@@ cent uses , problems that previously were hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair trainees , can be identified and addressed more quickly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed due to ethical bre@@ aches of the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry on @-@ line .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which raised the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only operations .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the data is useless if the administrators of a company take no action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , when a company asks staff for your feedback , there may be an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes don &apos;t come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ fy employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on gathering data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , associates wonder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
are you taking care of this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly associate surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond between employees in a sector that is well @-@ known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11@@ pm when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers conver@@ se on one side of the team &apos;s new practice areas on campus .
some pulled out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before returning to the water man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 a.@@ m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday was Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , six playing times in West@@ wood did practical exercises .
they should do 18 exercises during August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the regulation amend@@ ment of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them for three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they went on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ ker@@ Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been ej@@ ected with foot@@ balls leaving a protective net behind a gate post , will not be an easy task .
Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel this weekend but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think people are renting a room there and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the video tape from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties and then show their results under the original post , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fac@@ tual reviews , which may show results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , while the French voters were floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly remove hat@@ eful posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook told in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts sc@@ rut@@ iny was started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories of third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; related items &quot; and work on other changes in its news feed to reduce false messages .
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy sitting in the irri@@ gation River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship , to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another , emerging British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ck May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Is@@ abel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; that &apos;s his thumb print !
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , I have under@@ rated my welcome sal@@ ute &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the assembled trou@@ ghs of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with landsc@@ apers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the era of the English Empire , maps showing who owned what : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight for the two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all his gear ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se themselves in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il appearing in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it Pat@@ ron whom the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed quite Ga@@ un@@ er to always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise them . &quot;
after the end of his essay in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences
he has spent a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ me@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the revelation of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan at home .
at the end of August it is said to be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too good for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the leaders of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the action it &apos;s more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is imperative to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one which gives the city a distinctive unique feature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , she is competing with other communities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost an average five @-@ digit amount as its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week too .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the seat of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings , under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Vice @-@ Re@@ ers and the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part .
thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government is attracting the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the coup failed , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a re@@ pul@@ ator of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , this week has been negotiated in Ankara .
even in the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; fully cleanse &quot; the armed forces .
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; un@@ e@@ as@@ iness within the military headquarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the aboli@@ tion of the head cover ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the large @-@ scale suit in the army and the security forces certainly goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan decre@@ ed another 73@@ 95 civilian workers , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan imposed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a named officer , who was seeking asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , after pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish Army in the Alliance after pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weak , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
it fores@@ ees to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ based vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by changing the way citizens are issued out of other countries &quot; Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the present system .
this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that benefits our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media .
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for rac@@ er shuttle
over the past few months , over and over again the future of the race pitch has been cont@@ ested - now it is planned to go quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train runs is to be built .
according to the Department of Transport , construction work on the track should commen@@ ce in order to secure the future of the race pitch in the long term .
&quot; with the decision to continue ordering and san@@ itation the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is particularly committed to tourism , &quot; explained the secretary of the Traffic State Klaus Sender on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he estimated the cost of maintaining the track to some 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country assumes 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the Shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared atonement .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there@@ with the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said atonement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by many people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very pale in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a big deal .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on releasing his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ b@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex Ro@@ bot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed characters like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an advent@@ urous personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapted to your personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; enth@@ uses the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape if you go one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , upset one the most .
on his website true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy beha@@ ved with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is said on the website .
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with sub@@ ju@@ gation as an optional addition .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R records their increasing popularity , they remain tent@@ atively on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened by women worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who pre@@ tends that women have been sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ fying aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos; s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphical pictures , the swal@@ lowed body and the ex@@ tin@@ ct eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as possible ( al@@ beit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , brought to the point when it comes to their personalities , the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ gation .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to say it in the saying of 2017 : maid girls
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tr@@ ump in the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate have split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all ost@@ ensi@@ bly compl@@ aining to let our filter bubbles pop .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is in another context that it also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ aid us some@@ day .
however , there is an even more difficult long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ cans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ ab@@ len@@ ess compared to its standards .
I find myself being attacked today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal offen@@ se .
when Tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only need to be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ cked and the animals turn to look after their own shoulders - extremely glo@@ omy and the music @-@ per@@ ing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite beyond the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Them@@ atic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a large round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as two @-@ year @-@ old , 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40@@ s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what is actually a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required .
the poor woman in the department store stood ou@@ tra@@ geous , while I we@@ ary made the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us reloc@@ ated to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
he was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 , throwing them on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us said that he held his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der that hid herself in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to put an appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ eal , from which they say she was too indul@@ gent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the &quot; Blum@@ berger Schools &quot; schools , the fourth @-@ grade students from F@@ ail and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in future , four to the secondary school .

the 29 students of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young Eagle growing up in the yard , but then released into freedom .
to this end , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar conducted a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it hat@@ ch from its chi@@ ckens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a chicken sh@@ attered himself ; the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen &apos;s dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who wore cylinders to make the bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wanted every quarter that he felt accepted in his new school .
there followed thanks to the colleagues , former school@@ master Michael Müller , who repeatedly ski@@ ps in the classroom and the parents &apos; representatives .
the Ken@@ yan time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher declared .
after two years of teaching , she only dis@@ ap@@ points her students , because it was a really great time .
in the end , they can rely on the four @-@ metre goods .
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in the process , great joy broke out with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , divided the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
in the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal camp people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported on B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camping and put up to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?
an overview of the most important questions and answers .
at the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emission characteristics of emissions classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the exception of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives app@@ rais@@ als :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schum@@ an Software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers receive updates about updates ?
manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet named an exact date .
Daimler told us to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done in its framework .
how long are the conver@@ sions expected to take place overall ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as the political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily until now on the issue of the environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer , according to S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will fear that .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
so far there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE advises to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first R@@ apper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
like the cultural institution on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally , U.S. president Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner , announced with progressive TV series , announced that he would not miss to take part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the talk with Tr@@ ump to make clear her view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
the former winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ ch &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the job is already written out - however , suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a municipal engineer for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that the requirements profile has not been fulfilled so far .
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the earliest possible stage .
thus - considering the regular periods of notice - there should still be enough time to work out .
as Has@@ lach works for the administration community as the Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant must present corresponding degrees .
for this function does want to keep the city in any case .
if they cannot fill this out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the clos@@ eness to the city is important to the city and to it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good mood between the authorities and the citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , which W@@ acker can look back on with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain about the building department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park were initiated .
the Chain Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium reconstruction is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the latter will book with around € 1.5 million , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
creative is available for a city building master of great le@@ e@@ way .
with Has@@ la@@ f &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , it can be re@@ acted quite flexibly in many respects .
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .
as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for what fits in , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the reti@@ ring city @-@ builder emphasizes .
anyway , the city building master bears a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of experience in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker desires : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .
if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the city of Has@@ lach , you should have a completed academic degree as a graduate engineer or a bach@@ elor with speci@@ alisation in architecture and have good specialist knowledge in the fields of construction planning and construction planning .
the municipal building department is subject to civil engineering and civil engineering , construction management planning , sc@@ aling facilities , management of municipal property , urban depot with building yard and urban gar@@ dening as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including monument protection .
bike thrown on pi@@ pelines : southern railway route locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ oben Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged so severely that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpet@@ rators and have been looking for them since the night hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
near the crime scene , a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been witnessed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Laus@@ itz@@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he or the perpet@@ r@@ ator could have brought themselves in great danger and also endangered the traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locom@@ oti@@ ves and the system , as well as the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement , there could also be pat@@ rons of the railway customers on the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; overall , the speaker said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A considerable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern run@@ way could be managed without hin@@ dran@@ ce .
nearly ten passenger trains dropped off Friday morning , two of them concerned the correspondence .
freight trains did not fall , but they did not delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the person concerned is usually advised to ste@@ er meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .
if the balance is too long in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium takes tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their diet , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el effects if the same system is also found in people .
the Post@@ doc@@ tor@@ an@@ din Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separate , did not have this .
it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ des of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from mice .
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United , N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; Gen@@ ie , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound of signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season match , before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ gio and Andreas Per@@ eira left for pleasure .
but matic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start @-@ 11th for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club has already done a fantastic job , fulfilling three of its four primary new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the Sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle in Washington state , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ igan and with@@ drew in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the radar shield was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
how the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , Social Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
merely no fire from the party headquarters , merely a head@@ wind out of the League , was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from Willy Brandt &apos;s House are observing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were set@@ backs .
and one by one .
following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U faces a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising faction of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green federal president , Michael Kell@@ ner , called on the apost@@ olic Green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U signi@@ fies a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately res@@ ign her mandate , &quot; said the Federal President and Vice President of the Green Party Network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; an SPD election warri@@ or si@@ ghs when the new press message reaches the party centre on Friday morning .
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U after the transition of green de@@ pu@@ ties to the CD@@ U without his own majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ sing began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , cal@@ med the comrades at that time .
after the regional elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
and that &apos;s what it got - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te s@@ nat@@ ched the party smoothly .
the comrades were lab@@ orious again in the weeks afterwards .
then , when they had just acquired new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit from Hamburg came .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor O@@ la@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made quite everything wrong with what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz is fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
the prime minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ atmosphere and its role in the supervisory board .
the survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the Con@@ federation over the past few weeks .
the aspir@@ ation of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .
they allowed him to be able to stabili@@ se the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no blame on the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz at all .
for the time being , comrades , therefore , endeav@@ our to keep its own ranks closed .
their anger depends on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ ester introduces her own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , leader of the party lef@@ tist in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Ms. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person but on the national list of the Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony , so the Lower Sax@@ on de@@ pu@@ ties continued .
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , CEO of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democratic maneu@@ vers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Wei@@ l as prime minister , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member fal@@ si@@ fies the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local cores III
those who want to rehabil@@ itate their house in the years can get support from the country in the near future .
mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg City Development told about this on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ in@@ dler had once again a review of what has been happening .
since 1991 , there have been a lot of san@@ itation areas .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , recent renov@@ ations are a &quot; successful project &quot; - it is also important to promote inner development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , I received the information from the Government Pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a refur@@ bish@@ ment area III .
the funding amount was € 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 , of which € 500 000 comes from the country , the rest of the congregation &apos;s feelings .
how does a san@@ itation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will , as Sch@@ in@@ dler further investigate , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area at all to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area boundaries could be post@@ p@@ one again .
the bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out .
core of the program are the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is per plot .
the renovation area would then eventually be defined as a statute .
since 1 January 2017 , the funding period for the subsidies runs until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until September this year , the survey would take place only once , within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out .
as soon as possible , in November or December , the statutory provisions will be made in order to begin with the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then declared that each commun@@ e must carry out the said preliminary examinations .
it is a question of evaluating and deciding on the extent to which the urban development is to be assessed and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will even come back to his senses and get a picture of the situation , promised them .
Got@@ zel affir@@ med that the project was a key success factor for the project .
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays .
the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; which deals with the structural condition and the renovation views , among other things .
in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing sheets , &quot; information about the size , layout and residents of a living room can be made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire does not at the same time provide an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler insist@@ ed that the distribution of the funding is functioning according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who comes first , first gr@@ ind .
one could not reserve funding for later . &quot;
finally pictures of the project &quot; Urban Centr@@ es II &quot; were presented in order to make a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; tasty . &quot;
British invent@@ or uses a micro@@ chip to move in house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now incorporated both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the shi@@ py@@ ards of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ al helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises the American production last month , tax@@ pay@@ ers cost up to $ 24@@ ,000 according to the military &apos;s information given to the TI@@ ME magazine .
the green and white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , which was made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was on display next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a petrol station from Wisconsin and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , after the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy Commander of Marine for Aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the appointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; said the commander .
&quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; answered the deputy commander .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but demanding their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
in February , Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation as the presidential plane against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages compl@@ aining about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is thri@@ lled by the &quot; Made In America &quot; show - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South La@@ wn in order to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted 58 training land@@ ings in the White House .
the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted in the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers took over the burden on none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a si@@ kor@@ sky spokes@@ man said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not run budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour .
recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers based on estimates of reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study in 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .
at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to emphasize that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it wasn &apos;t clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered the tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task
the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a joins the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blau @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will kick off tomorrow from 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel on the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite the five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable balance sheet , the leader of the Second Tennis Bundes@@ lig@@ a got the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has anyway respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the post@@ erior positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for class and stability at the S@@ V Su@@ chs@@ dorfer , mainly imports from the high North are concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to interventions in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with views of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ sk@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us as always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high north is handy .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , which is currently active at the Chall@@ enger Tournam@@ ent in the Italian Bi@@ ella , won the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) at his first use this season .
yesterday , the previously un@@ defeated chil@@ dr@@ ens Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo appeared with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
he was to be present in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Juli@@ en C@@ agn@@ ina .
after his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ dor@@ z could once again move to the team .
if it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ran@@ king in January 2016 , someone from the coach house Mari@@ us Z@@ ay fills the cad@@ re .
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he put his signature under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the law , Congress submitted a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft looks at pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of O@@ MV are concerned , which together with other European companies co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea In@@ sit@@ ut Nord Stream 2 .
the threat of dr@@ um@@ ming is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estimation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would even have to bring the sanctions to life by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; looked at what the company could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him .
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put to the fore in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Kil@@ ler reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x hasn &apos;t been over for a long time yet .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest show lights of the show .
with the third season , DE@@ A has focused its attention on the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ cart@@ el .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate as &quot; Fort@@ une 500 companies &quot; with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) orders the Mexican association , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .
the third season of Nar@@ co will begin on 1 September .
r@@ ô@@ le backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen utensils
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch time again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
on 1 September the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens ( Kit@@ as ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all were very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking is kept out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked meals .
the town runs 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 children receive a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time .
last Kit@@ a@@ year there were 2,@@ 800 children sitting at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are served 45 hours of the week in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 particle @-@ time employees have kitchen service starting on 1 September : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give off the food , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are allocated to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides about the range of the ho@@ ur@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen staff now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s all about : healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .
&quot; children should help prepare food . &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - previously also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service also the charm which it has exhibited in the cost comparison between own control and foreign award for the city as the most economical means it is from the press office .
and this , although 46 particle @-@ time forces are re@@ configured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong for around 750 people in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ ek , acting head of the United Nations mission , said hundreds of women are being can@@ oni@@ zed in the provinces . three women are fighting for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Tali@@ ban have published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to a consult@@ ative role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
Hay@@ om said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million registered voters are registered .

two young men at the age of 19 and 23 have tried to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to police information , the men were talking to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who kept up with friends on the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at 2 : 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone .
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old rejected the request and continued with her friends .
as a result , one of the offen@@ ders tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed .
the duo escaped without prey .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Don@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to as@@ certain the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant in managers of bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company talked about the future of investing in the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work at the plant producing hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies alongside other products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in the last years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressing concerns that the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here and the labour forces concentrate heavily on the local community and the Glasgow &apos;s Greater Region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we appreciate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with our employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly review our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga likes its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not indul@@ ge in its persecution of N@@ ey@@ mar after giving an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger its release cl@@ auses , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
following completion , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans state insist@@ ed that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned of the PS@@ G president three years ago before this prospect ?
when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players with them , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti in the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator deliberately dropped off a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property No. 30 and thus caused damage of more than 200 Euros in the fair@@ ing of the vehicle .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for clu@@ es .
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to diver@@ t his car and tou@@ red the circuit board .
on Thursday evening the 34 year old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was traveling with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the town surrounded by Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane so that he had to switch to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the circuit board .
damage to the car emerged on the car .
the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .
according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the Merc@@ ed@@ es@@ driver had not noticed the accident .
the police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au under Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Reporting on the mis@@ use cases rati@@ fies Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann means .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publication in relation to the German press agency , he was ap@@ ologi@@ ze from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Cathedral Choir Champion Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised the fact that &quot; double standards &quot; are measured when reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
in regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful deeds &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Hist@@ orian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee , may be con@@ spic@@ uous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go to the church and that &apos;s a perfect fres@@ her . &quot;
she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows have been a quite normal educational tool , &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for the past decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports of abuse , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes , who wrote the &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) .
&quot; I need to protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; E@@ zek@@ iel says , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report .
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment at the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of transgres@@ sions , 67 dom@@ es@@ tic@@ ated cats .
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotion@@ ality the punishment for the students could also be more intense .
nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims said that a lot of victims rated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him in spite of violence . &quot;
in the interview , E@@ zek@@ ne explains why the report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
Mr. E@@ zek@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of exercise of violence on protective fighters at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; are a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
on the one hand , many students emphas@@ ise his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible in the case of the oil , when a cathedral treas@@ ury has not brought any top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as a bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you still have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also occurred outside his sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to reproach him , to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gymn@@ asi@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he worked was felt by virtually all respon@@ dents as &quot; redemption &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also wrote an excellent testimony , describing it as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as a very good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly cared for the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and was &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which led to rage erup@@ tions .
the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and cast the key@@ ring on the ground , but also drew ear tips and over@@ looked che@@ ek@@ y guys at the hair or ears , he had admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time , 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
compared to what it actually is about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , they are of course bag@@ at@@ els .
one wonders whether it is not more with his famili@@ arity and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed on him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in connection with the report , the media reported a great deal on the issue of mis@@ use in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be charged in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Choir .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the affected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem of educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most of the victims are silent .
if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not for a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators to a professional degree .
how do students assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in reducing abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a ques@@ tioning pup@@ il formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) could have had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have more intru@@ sive or clearer or even more open compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
that you talk to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report conclu@@ des with the clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he entrusted himself in the run @-@ up to affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free of any involvement .
so he can &apos;t be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to display .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media there was much to read about &quot; non @-@ violent eating &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; om@@ is@@ sion &quot; in the report .
does he have to live with this reproach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violent eating and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , there is a clear separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent eating , as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole aw@@ ful test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were literally har@@ assed and mal@@ treated and suffered from them , took place at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions had to prevail .
but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the site gymn@@ asi@@ um .
on this , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what else was different on the site gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but not a sa@@ di@@ stic force .
and this is true also for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
thus , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported of the conditions at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( thus the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut the ears consistently in front of the conditions ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even re@@ produces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment will continue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended an urgent action .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably still knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
that &apos;s just not true .
only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time of that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans speak of the &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is right now .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
this is all aw@@ ful and I am happy that it will finally be worked up .
but at the same time I must take protection from Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is , to pull ear tips and ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was banned , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to .
what picture of his time in Regensburg , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , has shown in our conversations with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ?
did the subject test sentence also come to language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about his brother Joseph &apos;s life , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI said from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen just played a secondary role .
nevertheless , I did not at all conc@@ eal that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trade , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boys will no longer be a great singer and before every success , regardless of the field , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you see Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the conversations with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep @-@ believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I receive regular contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ti@@ ation , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who did not forgive him until today that he was once strict to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lo@@ vable respect , to which they still look up and they down@@ right ven@@ er@@ ate them .
and please , once more clearly , all that is presented to him are the methods of education that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is only too obvious the evil intent behind it .
for the report that has just been published rati@@ fies it .
now the lawyer would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its , and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
