<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irish institution, where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the erstwhile land of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, which had to be exciting because the Navi Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but up-to-date - yet therefore very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of Munich Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">Detailed maps, so-called primordial papers, were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the data of the Bavarian Palace Department between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first surveying of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second coalition war with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops marched off with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV Joseph further promoted the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying administration.</seg>
<seg id="19">The originating sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of Early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was established 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. 1877, as the Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten number of manuscripts from the so-called "judgment" from which the basic tax was deduced.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "small plots there are no farmers there today - but small gardeners of the" "" "" "" "Land in Sun" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, since 1810 the scene of the October festival, was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the district of today's district au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people once locked people with insanity.</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was developed.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended the killing of so-called Irish." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 seats.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was insufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrendezvous in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianism are now meeting in the area of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">The football pitch of the TSV Munich east is west, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architecturally reminiscent of the origin of the Irrente, which was destroyed during World War II during bomb attacks.</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as "Main Square," the shopping street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944 the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business buildings and a crypt from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days were the preparatory work and on April 5, 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Fitting Fares issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racial attacks by the State.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls for Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel by the State and take extreme care, as a number of questionable, racial-based events lately exist in the entire state and mentioned here," it says in the Group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately aim at minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you have violations of civil rights that happen to people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents like racial offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and taken into custody by the Missouri Police, without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Administrative Office's Office, showing that black motorists in the state are being stopped by 75 percent more frequently than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "" "" "Chapel said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "people must be ready to bring in chewing money or let relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classifies the state with regard to the number of such violations at the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws that would oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for migration violations, which will contribute to further racial profiling in the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">Soft aunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Magic Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have provided a picture on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU association together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the Schwendemann family court yard.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann gave us an insight into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwaldmilch" is for him the alternative marketable marketing path for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="73">Regionals exclusively arrive at the Feriengäste dinner table.</seg>
<seg id="74">Since he is also a BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the soft aunching project as "elementary."</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot generate profitably on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area care for a lot of work, a lot must be worked with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "" "" "Schwendemann stressed.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not conduct a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "for mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear:" "" "" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the soft-aunted project and is happy about the leader-promotion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the afforestation of the land could still be extended for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to carry on their farm," "" "" "" "said the Mayor." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often under criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of openness is 40 hectares, which must not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Half of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted by Leader, a quarter carried the community of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers left 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers."</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "" "" "also for Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "" "" "best food is produced here." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Council Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables state sponsoring of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveying backdrop marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced must not be sluggishable (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots who would like to build a fence just under 16 kilometres is currently underway for the Fisherman's Weiluaunay Project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The most secure sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans cherish this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump régime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-imitators would have retrieved him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on its importance, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller's Acosta described, "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to will be added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your afflicted masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the eleventful waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "" "" "there was never a time when the" "" "" "" "poor" "" "" "" "was better seen on our screens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller didn't engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about America's significance.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she performed a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical representation.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The big scream Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo-conservatism that brings the American flame to the rethought world: "Lady Liberty is advancing.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "" "" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh encountered quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, poor but hopeful people after long and often awful travels on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue talks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not supposed to illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black looses Scottish Members of the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scotsmen belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain.</seg>

<seg id="143">"" "" "" "the passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth world championship in the 400-m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best overall number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-distance runner Muir leads on this road and last year saw five British and two European records set up.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games after a great season.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle recalls her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the Lee McConnell team.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is very proud of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only a team, but in some cases also medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but to know that my teammate voted for me and elected me, makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking criticisms on Facebook: do not apply to a public office if you cannot tolerate the preheating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He slipped in the critique, secure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "" "" "because in 1783 Washington said," "" "" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan to work on more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defendants it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "" "" "many people said." "" "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hoof head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to bust his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum designated as official and of employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or buntings or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "" "" "what the governor's staff described as" "" "" "" "concentrated spam" "" "" "" "would probably call" "" "" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last violated the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It shouldn't be that hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter tachographers enacted upon his leadership.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his post, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>

<seg id="259">An existing movement, which stirred up independence from the Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers.</seg>

<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wood resources worth $78 billion.</seg>
<seg id="274">These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensure that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $20 million local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in one single officer.</seg>
<seg id="276">Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.</seg>

<seg id="304">Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.</seg>

<seg id="347">The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribal members Mee, Moni, Dani and damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="348">Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by infecting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never appear again.</seg>
<seg id="352">Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty boosts dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice being sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially Nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">Agriculture is the task of women, each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes.</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the crop for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).</seg>
<seg id="360">Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new air routes to the airport of Nabire.</seg>

<seg id="365">Beyond that, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.</seg>
<seg id="366">Beginning of the year French reporters Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions, although they were given the rare permission to film.</seg>
<seg id="367">According to Phelin Kine, the deputy Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokhov's campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized.</seg>

<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papua.</seg>
<seg id="370">In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread injuries" in Papua including Paniai shooting.</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">The spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the accusations of the group and said to journalists in Jakarta: "in Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>

<seg id="375">Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they will probably not vote for Jokwai again.</seg>
<seg id="376">"Jokhoi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the President of the tribal Council.</seg>

<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 percent said they had knowingly carried items with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it asked travelers across the country to find out how many mistakenly sent smuggling goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that people who are knowingly smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - carry the safety, those who fly most frequently.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk happily announces the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has previously undermined that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk will reveal another, less glamorous number for the first time in announcing the latest quarterly balance: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk had often advertised more than 500,000 preorders for the new car whose extradition has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: from the total of 518.000 reservations, 63.000 have already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have always pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla pays 1000 Euros (in the US $1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">Currently 45,000 such unbinding reservations accrue, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>

<seg id="435">Those who order a "Model 3" may expect deliveries early in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive his brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilisation.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if it comes to greater delays, then the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="439">EPA Head Pruitt retracts due to the reluctance of the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions</seg>
<seg id="440">A day after being sued by 15 states Scott Pruitt, the chief of the environmental protection authority, took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Prupp presented the change when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous job in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a period expiring on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for down-to-earth Ozon.</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would be delayed for a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or hampering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment, was a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly been persuaded to block or delay regulation that resists the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Prupp regulatory rollback agenda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a federal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration, which obligated oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt indicated that his reversal in ozone standards simply met the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA often fails to comply with the deadlines and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others," "" "" "", "said Pruitt, who complained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the Ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A draft law approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet voted in the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="457">The New York general prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states accused of the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain the legal pressure.</seg>
<seg id="458">"the conversion of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important benefit for the health and security of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneider said.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumours celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius-Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade is invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday 16th July.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historical St. Hilarius Villa is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingens a concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in documentary records: count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church on Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, in addition to the former parish church, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a noble court to which the church or the patronage was owned and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the lower village and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 underline these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, furnished and occupied with a pastor, still remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">This was the right to appoint a priest or propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greatest of the two debarred at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be delivered later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortunes, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower-werg existing today remained as a witness to the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wish are cultivating the "Schaffhausen retired" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">On Sunday 16th July, the Friends and Donors of Tumlingens invite to the sixth Serenade on the old cemetery of St. HilariusChapel.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Place leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the end of the serenade a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows towards the forest," the organizers set out the fantastic views.</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade is only held in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius-system, which is of importance for tumours and listeners.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>
<seg id="504">Association wants to let approval of wind turbines prove</seg>
<seg id="505">Boisheim refused "sees no legal precondition for the construction and therefore turned to the councilor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The association "Boisheim refuses." Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) has called on its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 there would be no wind turbines at all in the Boisheim Nette, as at the time in Viersen there was only a wind force concentration zone in Viersen at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone is an exclusion of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent a "recess" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had approved a second wind power concentric zone in the Boisheim Nette by a change in the land use plan - but they had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf because of a fault.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "due to the lack of planning permission, the granted approval decision remains unlawful and therefore also to take back" "" "" "", "said Christoph Erkens, president of" Boisheim. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="513">State-of-the-art state of affairs: before the summer break the councillor once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "Erkens:" "" "" "" "with this the issuance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out according to plan." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="517">The circle makes it the occasion to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they are unlikely to cause the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">With regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the arguments of the Boisheim association.</seg>
<seg id="520">NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans the construction of four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town Viersen was involved indirectly, closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare estate.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW level plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="532">Bad Langeneier and people from the region will rediscover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September.</seg>
<seg id="533">The commercial association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the shopping spree into the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="534">As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend aims to sensitize customers, which offers the own city away from the usual supermarket product.</seg>
<seg id="535">Thus, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.</seg>
<seg id="536">In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their apprenticeships.</seg>
<seg id="537">In addition, the shops of the city centre will invite you to "midnight shopping."</seg>
<seg id="538">In doing so, the campaign aims not only for residents of the city and the nearby region.</seg>
<seg id="539">In preparation, commercials are on the radio, an internet video and printed pouches pointing out on the promotional weekend, so Christian König.</seg>
<seg id="540">The municipal administration and business association cooperates with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</seg>
<seg id="541">This means that the commercial association and the city are entering a further stage of the project "Attractive city centre."</seg>
<seg id="542">This includes new offerings, such as the first "active day" to the well-fest with salted Sunday, talks with all trades and hosts, in order to make them active participation.</seg>
<seg id="543">Attractive offers on Saturday and the abandonment of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.</seg>
<seg id="544">In addition, customer potentials should be reopened or re-opened again.</seg>
<seg id="545">These include spa guests and tourists.</seg>
<seg id="546">But many locals also lost sight of the city centre when shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to invigorating the city centre - to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and associations.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a matter of overcoming the lethargy with a network, which had spread to some extent, as king said in the spring.</seg>
<seg id="549">Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, informed that five Thuringian cities take part in the third "home shopping" day nationwide.</seg>

<seg id="753">On the ground floor it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the municipal council levitates that such a common room is not intended as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the seniors-just housing, but openly into the community.</seg>

<seg id="756">The decision, which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current household last autumn, will be made possible by funding opportunities.</seg>

<seg id="884">The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">They should take a closer look at the assessment of the age during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) has been criticized for the assessment of the correct age of some refugees who were minor.</seg>
<seg id="887">Until today, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 tests to test cases, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has published the results from a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017.</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person "might be under 18 years old."</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are carried out only in cases in which the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">According to Johan Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent over the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="892">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we see no big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," "" "" "" "he said to the journal The Local." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">When the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year.</seg>
<seg id="896">The method of medical age assessment, where x-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>
<seg id="897">A skeptic is the Endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves the appraisal of biological maturity of people to see if they usually went through puberty sooner or later than usual.</seg>
<seg id="898">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"" "" "" "if we cannot say it, we should not do as if we could," "" "" "" "he said to the newspaper Metro." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="901">However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "in general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.</seg>
<seg id="902">"" "" "" "the greatest risk is if the person is under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="903">Full in the plan</seg>
<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg proceeds well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday a seven-tonne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it runs great," "" "" "" "says Reinhold Leicht, Construction Manager at the Department of Road Construction and Transport at the District Executive Committee Freiburg." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, work began at the same time on all three rehabilitated bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is maintained.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a rainbow bridge made of concrete coated with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the two other bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were erected in 1939 and are twelve, respectively 10,60 metres long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now been preserved on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a side fixing that is also used as a working path.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2,20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special finger tips have required laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable that many companies are connected to.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished first.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the farm buildings and the collection pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach town entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.</seg>
<seg id="929">The cost of the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="930">The whole thing is financed by the country.</seg>

<seg id="941">The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein, showing presence in front of the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.</seg>

<seg id="946">With a view of the event on the rear square he says: "this is the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful."</seg>
<seg id="947">This is also the case: around 8pm a band for entertainment, in the Stadthalle various orators, among them the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.</seg>
<seg id="948">In the hall are about 200 people waiting for the leading candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the vice-president Beatrix of Stork to keep their speeches.</seg>
<seg id="949">The police presence remains unchanged, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.</seg>
<seg id="950">A little more than an hour the AfD event takes place, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is announced shortly after 9pm.</seg>

<seg id="958">Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like a new garment, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the jazz musician Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall art work.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of football impact on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending on European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the executive organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in the face of the financing of the team by the energy-rich family of the Qatari host family.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must interact with legitimate income sources that enable them to break the break-even point in their activities related to football.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheated and cracked to ruin, when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year investment period that runs until 2018, clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And despite the fact that Platini fell into favour in 2015 by the Presidency, his successor Aleksander Ceferin will continue to frighten excessive expenses.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"certainly FFP is not dead and we will continue to reinforce the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the revenues for the next five years can be accounted for at EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the most severe sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsorship was boosted by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar about payments made by the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar have argued that Neymar WM will be ambassador and a such maneuver for UEFA regulatory authorities could easily be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros, generated a profit of more than 10 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG anticipates that Neymars's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and tricotine sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said President of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS with respect to Qatar's last owner of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years," "" "" "" "said Wenger on Thursday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1156">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "once a country has an association, everything is possible." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new company supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">In recent years Chocolat Frey has made board chocolate for Swiss.</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is in front of a possible end: the airline is relaunching its mission.</seg>
<seg id="1161">On request of the news agency SDA, Swiss-speaking Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" of Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and undergo a quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1165">Around 17 million small red-white packaged beauty tablets up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to provide any information about the costs.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of approximately CHF 1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: for a chocolate manufacturer it is a prestigious assignment.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss will not be able to reveal how many candidates there is for the new invitation to tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But there are only Swiss manufacturers in question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report Chocolat Frey wants to make an effort to renew the contract in spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the SDA, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Chocolate tablets have been distributed to Swiss since 2006 on board their flights.</seg>
<seg id="1174">Before Swiss Life concluded a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut has supplied chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss opted for the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">On long haul flights, the First Class customers are spoiled with goodies from the confectionery Sprüngli, in Business Class the passengers Schoggi von Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi von Chocolat Frey.</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era.</seg>

<seg id="1190">At one point, a character sticks through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy-malignant plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is involved, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-sung impression by Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillons Underlippenbart of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random insanity that could heat up this franchise, like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I believe as his logical conclusion: "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the band premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>

<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the road of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues from Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can be synchronised in English.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is very committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>

<seg id="1294">The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as an important new intervention, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "decisive moment."</seg>
<seg id="1295">Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to enable the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prep-positional prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep prior to intercourse means taking just enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable candidates are identified, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled through antiretroviral therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People who live in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">The study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "" "" "Stevens said:" "" "" "" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">"" "" "" "it is another milestone in the more than three decades lasting progress in overcoming one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1307">Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Prep, if targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people, provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="1309">From September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.</seg>
<seg id="1310">"" "" "" "we warmly welcome this announcement." "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"" "" "" "Ian Green, Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "" "" "" "the priority must now lie that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1312">"" "" "" "now, as the prep test medicine was procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1313">Sharon Hodgson, Minister of Health, said: "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">It is now important that this study will be carried out across the country as quickly as possible in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will contribute to a step closer to the end of the dissemination of HIV in society. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," Joanne said.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "" "" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous slab height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "" "" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored in order to let it work for longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "some engineering art went inside," "" "" "" "explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very important, so if you push the door upside down, it is very easy to glide." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here, they managed to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials, which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "" "" "says Erfan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you don't love electrical sockets in the walls." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of something really amazing in something.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in an argument about one of the largest real estate empire Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer college, Colin De Lutis, lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court in order to explain how to divide their property and business.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, Brunswick's development areas and Sorrento, apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">According to an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owns 316 million dollars and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The allocation of real estate and cash has proven to be problematic for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "" "" "he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday the first court hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded it.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but provokes Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "my Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," "" "" "" "he wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs increase in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to purchase Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeansry of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began in Westco when he was "in my last years of High School when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property on to their sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "" "" "she wrote." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>

<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new head of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more even course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Head of Staff of the White House, met with executive employees on his first day of work, he presented a major issue to President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information which fell into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the coworkers that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by supervising his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "President Trumps" relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if a candidate was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," "" "" "" "said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigners, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying price."</seg>
<seg id="1400">OK. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know - that Trumps tweets would have included even more combustibles without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about tweets that have not sent Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his staff managed it several times to keep his anger away from him, then their efforts have paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Control controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that perhaps promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - fully occupied with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with embarrassing leaks, and that he gets to see where they come from." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly that happened at the end of February when someone maliciously gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "being the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicanes or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "" "" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House General Secretary, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork and receive the pump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work out?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tried three months later to do the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive Self, and his counselors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The forest hotel Luise will be from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is to be reopened on the 1st of March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof hotels by the then ambience of operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014 about 30,000 nights per year were lost and also revenue by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatic escalating figures of refugees arriving in the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective housing, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel site.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But especially Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and was already talking about serious interested parties in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergamo, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to bring it back to a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergamo and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Forest Hotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when entering the house it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is undertaken.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>

<seg id="1462">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is actually a lovely place," "" "" "" "Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>

<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">It doesn't want to be positioned at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale inner city level, Scherer points out.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The forest hotel Luise, with about 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The idea of the city was similar to that of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly according to the amount of investment.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under a million euros, he calculates.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">In a courtyard there is a large terrace which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special Investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "" "" "the committee recorded the work over the past few weeks," "" "" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported there were already first subpoenas of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time being specifically interfered with in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation focused on several men acting as an advisor to the Republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more trumps private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the "Washington Post" wrote that the Special Intermediator Trump had personally intervened in the centre and asked the accusation whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called ankee chambers.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The committee can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to discharge persons to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to CNN, charges have already been issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to testify that it was said in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. Trumps also became consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign manager Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening on the US television that the implementation shows that Mueller doesn't want to intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the rise of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the enforcement of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "" "" "said Trump." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1507">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the former FBI chief James Comey said three times that I will not be determined against the President." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1508">I have no reason to accept that something has changed, it continued to be explained in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because of this rationale, accusations against Trump have become loudly, he did not want to hinder the judiciary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">In June, Comey told a senate committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent special agent of the congress, such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented draft bills on Thursday, after which the special issuer could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: giant iceberg drives Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">In the Western Antarctic a giant iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin was solved by the Schelcowl.</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was shared by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">The colossus, weighing over a trillion ton and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably need two, three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">It is not a danger to human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change has played a role in the rupture of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">However, for some 30 years, however, there has been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelcoward.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelven's swimming pool is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcows is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this archipelago, the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete Schelcoward there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelcoward is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece is broken at a key.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and dispose ice as much water as it results after the melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly raise sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project writes for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelcoward is the fourth-largest awning of the Antarctic with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records" "" "" "", "he also confirmed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists whether the Larsen-C-Schelcoward will grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly coincide, his colleague Adrian Luckman added and added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers do not lead to the breakage of this gigantic iceberg not on climate change, many glacial tuffs of the Antarctic Peninsula have been discarded in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees in the last 50 years and thus number the areas in which the temperature rises the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a house-arif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant places, the CDU calls for the employers "association to come out to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just shortly before the summer break, 41 new jobs were enforced in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have their first day of work.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers of the circle are apparently very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were reported for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle is still lacking staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann circle.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in order to oppose the shortage of skilled labour in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "" "" "the administration should" "" "" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "" "" "" "according to the parties" desire. "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1562">The objective is to meet not only short-term needs at specialists, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orient itself inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-country climbers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">For the circle has to deal with personnel problems that one previously did not know.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "" "" "speech is about a regular" "" "" "" "contest of public employers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">So it is high time to act so that not even more positions remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, will go beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had already taken care of a bad surprise already in the day of the circle, when he publicly called out the personnel costs cap and startled the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all the possibilities to be reviewed which enable an exit from the communal employers' association.</seg>

<seg id="1574">In this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials when it actually foresees the collective bargaining for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are at present exactly prescribed, increases or more money is only available when you switch to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrants "lifeboats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Retreats' because their crew effectively worked together with human traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to express itself at the detailed allegations of Ambrogio Cartosio's Italian prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations raised at the moment after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat 'Youth Retreats', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that his crew receives dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of carrying away the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring about "essential changes or disabilities" of their rescue operations.</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel prize winner organization is Médecins sans Frontières (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti, meanwhile, said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had gone back in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors bore fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "" "" "said the Minister." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali about measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.</seg>

<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berlin Outer Outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region to enjoy the Trials and Sightseeings for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Wine Festival from Wachenheim was a welcome addition.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelchapel above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewing points followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far over the Palatinate Forest and the front-camped.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were again and again long ascents, for the long trials reward.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the national festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again there was an observation point at the lookout point, connected by "flew" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced again.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and lodges brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhaled curative brine in the open-air inhalatorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Will the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium ramps in the wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long since become a serious business, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scales included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognised the first federal liaisons, who are increasingly engaged in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire entirely new young audiences for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1618">"" "" "" "he is certain," "" "" "" "there are many clubs on this train." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers from different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen in the meantime advises one agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than to send the Bundesligan embassy to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games like "League Of legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation game are challenged at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligens have long established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">E-sport is already part of the official programme at the 2022 Games in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport at all?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbie has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classic sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and quick responsiveness are required.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "" "" "but there are also problems:" "" "" "" "doping is becoming more and more a topic." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high inclusive effect of E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the German Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, turnover is expected to reach 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">This is little against the 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, the e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey, "writes the Deloitte advisers.</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already international.</seg>
<seg id="1647">Big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez join the US team NRG eSports.</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood Actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport competition providers Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Also in Europe some things are happening.</seg>
<seg id="1650">In a Norwegian school, e-sport has been introduced as an instructional subject, says Frobbie.</seg>
<seg id="1651">According to Dutt, the first-league football associations in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-sport department.</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany lagged behind," explains VfB board Röttgermann.</seg>
<seg id="1653">Just falling into nostalgia and clearing old times is no longer enough today.</seg>
<seg id="1654">The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but to align the company at the same time on the modern market.</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitised world," meaning Dutt.</seg>
<seg id="1656">"you can't keep in mind that everything stays the same with football as it always was."</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle by a carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1726">It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on the T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "Frank Natus, president of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says:" "" "" "" "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that has been blocking Lemke." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest reversal point sees Natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the priority list of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1731">This year, the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is set to stand construction law.</seg>
<seg id="1732">A role in the plans of the country is also played by the West Bank of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan.</seg>
<seg id="1733">The goal is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says the spokesperson Cornelia Holtmann.</seg>
<seg id="1734">Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional, but internationally competitive firms.</seg>
<seg id="1735">The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) (Chamber of Commerce) (IHK) (Chamber of Commerce) (IHK) aims to stimulate the sales of a Rhineland-Palatinate Label in wine markets in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports falling for ten years.</seg>

<seg id="1737">The Handwerkskammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euros is foreseen for the passing master examination and 2500 euros if graduates do themselves independently within ten years of the master's training.</seg>
<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">According to Jan Glockauer, head of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier, Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said that the road construction was planned quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1741">From 56 new engineers who want to stop Wissing at the regional company Mobility, only 29 positions have been occupied.</seg>
<seg id="1742">The Chamber of Commerce is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices.</seg>
<seg id="1743">Christian Baldauf, CDU vice-president, refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country is investing more than 20 million euros in 2017 and 2018, less in receipt of country roads than suggested.</seg>

<seg id="1750">Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter-reaction</seg>
<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW chairman said that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," and thus referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the enterprises described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens, and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of automakers to install facilities to neutralize the exhaust gases ejected from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of dragging the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called depositors that regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but drive back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen employees were charged, others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigation by Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to bypass the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The involvement of Audi in the investigation could seriously strain Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.</seg>

<seg id="1776">Mordillos nodules and the laughter against the suffering</seg>
<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, the nostrils of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Also with 85 the Argentinian still draws and works on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">"" "" "" "his message: laughing," "" "" "" "for there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he was an artist for greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his statements, he is still in the drawing table, working every day for nearly ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his cute figures continue to find much dissemination worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousandrel as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time his figures in the 3D movie, which should be projected onto the screen in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases that transmit diseases, which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, an expert in the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence has effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rainfall in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cicaine, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant oars with a large number of flowers, we have underdeveloped smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">Solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evaporation of the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness.</seg>
<seg id="1806">The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1,200 year anniversary this year.</seg>

<seg id="1808">On these days, Krämer, guilds, traders, vaguchs or a carcass depot are to be experienced in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drugs wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists talk about what is safer: they want to bring their children into the office, which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the wage list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and as the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirer of Riodosia, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "" "" "Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoza building. two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Public Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders committed every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to trial.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodosia, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we distrust everybody." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoza in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks until his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times hit him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelfth Flow."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter ran away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day one or more people are shot on the street or that the Graveyard is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoza, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected ganglions bought each copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined the establishment of Riodosia with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the paper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish highly accurate investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoza, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in prosecuting Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He willingly admitted that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "" "" "he said at the time of the CPJ." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV.</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you must take over the task assigned to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "" "" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what went on?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodosia team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit there at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "" "" "now they ask," "" "" "" "was his love for routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their secret runways," "" "" "" "to move drugs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodosia in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers who the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1875">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "for the issue of this week, Riodosia has licked on three main stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was assassination of the brother of the former known speaker Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé of state expenditure, concentrating on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a souvenir sheet removed from the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who ruled over all political levels almost all the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez presented Valdez as the most informed source of abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past we had known what has happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slender body.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the killings of journalists, because the staff became something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Name disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests "SOS Press" on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day, the director, Bojorquez, is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities, spying journalists and letting them kill, because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">Since then, she has asked her to be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Last year, the media group "Articulo 19" assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "here I am for my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do what El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly reportedly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists escaped from their homeland or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for hazards.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted like the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>
<seg id="1909">For those who stay behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky choices.</seg>

<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years covering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy crude oil.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivores, although covered with armor and resembles a changing tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The strongly armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a confrontation, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed us to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurs has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to uncover it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the exemplar allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shade is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution was favoring the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this naturalosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "strong predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been to the chalk time," "" "" "" "said Brown." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to explore the animal on information about his life, including his conserved intestinal content to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosanzrier is truly remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk period." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1954">You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it is asleep. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaur standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mummified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine, near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the substituted dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were washed by western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater world of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remnants of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remnants still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as winning in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 motorway: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, miles-long staves - and Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, around 5pm stood between the junction boxes Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks, crashed into one another.</seg>
<seg id="1976">At first no information was given about the exact number of injured.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a matter of light to moderate injuries, said a police spokesperson.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large supply of emergency vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely closed towards Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, a circular was formed around ten kilometres long.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ reporter, it was also on the tramway to massive handicaps - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade was the hallmark of vehicle anchors, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident took place on the A8 motorway, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>
<seg id="1984">There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.</seg>
<seg id="1985">A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "comfort check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced: there is no insane sitting in the train and sleeping.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The conductor comes and wakes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the paperless ticket inspection.</seg>
<seg id="1994">One simply confirms by mobile phone that one has taken his place and thereby evaluates the ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test run runs on two tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the offer comes up, we will expand it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "" "" "it is expected to be available on many other long haul routes in Germany early next year," "" "" "" "said a railroad speaker." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"comfort Check-in" calls the ticket devaluation without conductor.</seg>
<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: one gets into the train, calls his ticket to "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customers will then receive a button for electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendees get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seating position Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives in place Y at ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger sits there with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, keep working, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The check-in has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train, which in turn should take advantage of passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"those who want to travel relaxed without a ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check their own in the DB Navigator.</seg>
<seg id="2010">This allows passengers to make their journey more personal on the train, "says Michael Peterson, DB's Marketing Executive Officer.</seg>
<seg id="2011">"" "" "" "second plus:" "" "" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents needed to degrade online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document you have to present.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to poor mood in the compartment or greater room and delays in controlling one's ticket and taking the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.</seg>
<seg id="2019">How an activist came to answer the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shocked to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting on the bed of an airbnb flat in St. Louis that she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18 year old child and it is still on the street," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with Handle @ TheePharoah has constantly been rescued on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was about to tweeten the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18 year old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns lifeless body stretched out on the street and remained there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone off to go back to tweets on the Canfield-Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">In another video, she said, another policeman shared his gun and cried, "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her statement.</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is not the type of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "" "" "I was angry and wept." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th century.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people living in community and filling the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">As Ferrell with her daughter, wearing a flower dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning "about the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "you remember when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "" "" "she recalled what she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18 year old boy who wasn't right." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "" "" "I could not take it with me," "" "" "" "said Ferrell later." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to become free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "" "" "I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape in Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said and noticed that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I had no experience in organizing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2057">It all happened. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors during an evening demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her camera man Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "" "" "a question came about Ferrell:" "" "" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community benefiting from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">As Folayan said recently in an interview: "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death trakt.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns was shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk," "" "" "" "said Davis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I will be represented." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is "not a Messiah" leader, but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrara's life show how she falls in love with her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the personalization of black people." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives Matter Movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after killing the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the movie "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement overall," "" "" "" "said Ferrell," "" "" "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "" "" "black gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "" "" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "" "" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">However, it insists that "this is not an affirmatial type of action," in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film on account of its identity.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was the person who shook this energy," "" "" "" "she said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is no coincidence even though she was at the forefront because in a life at these junctions as a black gay woman is so much at stake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2079">"" "" "" "you can sense your energy through the screen." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2080">Meanwhile the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she clings to a song and she feels obliged to remember this memory since she went to the street three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is our duty to fight for our freedom." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to megalomania: TV-readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though it hasn't been built for a long time yet.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct has split the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">There is hardly any cold on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the Bit-Gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city, including the rest of the shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of the construction work, this will be the end.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a Markthalle into the new building - at the Beda place with the opportunity to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been shopping in the farmer's market almost every week for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women again and again very gladly.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities, there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall is located in the gallery, depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "" "" "but this should not be very low for the new project." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets, I don't think it's superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, specialty shops no longer exist and what is left of it will probably also disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the peasant market stand during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes in actually.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery manage to distribute all business from Bitburg before? "</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">And no-one needs a shopping centre that is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless building projects in Bitburg do not have space anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Once the farmer's market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost identical - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haaretz, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year sentence, after she publicly posted diplomatic messages about WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is named A Becoming resemblance.</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transkins and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg was created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by maning and created from the 30 portraits, such as someone with this genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual commentary not only for the form of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also of identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already talked openly about the identification as a woman since she was puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of foreigners from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in jail and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "" "" "said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse were too unequal letters, which over the course of two years exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created an illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform Chelsea judgment and it would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama is actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years would demand in a military jail in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to flaring up the rigid divisions that it should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning demanded with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end of the "automatic fragmentation, of which gender, race, sexuality and culture have been."</seg>

<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in organic terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome will not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also visible.</seg>

<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University sought for murder</seg>
<seg id="2159">A nation-wide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who were looked for as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Cook County's Local Court.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died, 26, after several stitches.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials got a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot, and detectives investigate the stitches as murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubunker, Vice President for University Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem should now be assessed and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.</seg>
<seg id="2167">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University co-operates with this investigation," "" "" "" "said Cubump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A Speaker of the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help the US investigative authorities in every possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urges the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the police have an idea of their whereabouts and our efforts to locate them reinforce," "" "" "" "said Guglielmi." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip, which said something happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that loading and warts were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2181">The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>

<seg id="2187">And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study granted by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly subsidized doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "" "" "in terms of the matter, Mutko said," "" "" "" "We conduct the investigation, as our anti-doping system has made a mistake." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2192">Mutos's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">Speaking with the Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov launched problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "" "" "no one intends to accept this report unconditionally," "" "" "" "added Smirnov." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little help or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity" "" "" "", "said Errest, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Association Madison Reed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring staff engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, staff anonymity and complaints management lines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most ailments and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of nuisance in which those who have spoken have been punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">This wish is a lucrative business opportunity for start-ups such as GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year amid the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Over a short time, uber has registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent can send customized "Pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company finds its employees badly treated or unethical, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, Convercent has deployed for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of staff.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now, as the company Convercent uses, problems that previously were hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or states, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair trainees, can be identified and addressed more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," "" "" "" "said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical breaches of the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But it took until the "social media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry on-line.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer their software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which raised the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only operations.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their votes, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach yields when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but the data is useless if the administrators of a company take no action." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks staff for your feedback, there may be an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes don't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotify employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on gathering data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "because if you don't follow, associates wonder," "" "" "" "Have you really heard me?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Are you taking care of this?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "" "" "and if you don't care why should I?" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now performs monthly associate surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights into the employees and hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bond between employees in a sector that is well-known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you are not bound to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "" "" "said Vitrano." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 o'clock in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras, six playing times in Westwood did practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They should do 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a comic novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy sitting in the irrigation River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that's his thumb print!</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the assembled troughs of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>

<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, cast it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the era of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all his gear! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse themselves in the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil appearing in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit Patron whom the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was presented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen seemed quite Gauner to always pay debts and spend money on things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crisis by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise them. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his essay in the castle, Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämemäki, the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature.</seg>

<seg id="2337">Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army</seg>
<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) deliberates on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week too.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as formerly, but in the seat of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">At the meetings, under the chairmanship of the head of government, the five Vice-Reers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the headcount.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is attracting the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commander of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the coup failed, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired the 326 generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a repulator of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, this week has been negotiated in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Even in the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "fully cleanse" the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really handle the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the heading "uneasiness within the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the abolition of the head cover ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The large-scale suit in the army and the security forces certainly goes on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan decreed another 7395 civilian workers, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan imposed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan drives targeted an Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">In the magazine "Vocal Europe," a named officer, who was seeking asylum in foreign countries after the coup attempt, warned the Turkish army in a few years "full extremists and Salafists."</seg>
<seg id="2362">If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to rehabilitate track for racer shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Over the past few months, over and over again the future of the race pitch has been contested - now it is planned to go quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Even before the end of the year, the route on which the tourist train runs is to be built.</seg>
<seg id="2376">According to the Department of Transport, construction work on the track should commence in order to secure the future of the race pitch in the long term.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to continue ordering and sanitation the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is particularly committed to tourism," explained the secretary of the Traffic State Klaus Sender on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>
<seg id="2378">He estimated the cost of maintaining the track to some 2.5 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Of this sum, the country assumes 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2380">The contract, based on which the Shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalised, declared atonement.</seg>
<seg id="2381">The Ministry and the South Thuringia train as operator are already in agreement with the technical details.</seg>
<seg id="2382">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therewith the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," "" "" "" "said atonement." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2383">The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company is closed for a period of eleven years.</seg>
<seg id="2384">As a result, the Rennsteig Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.</seg>
<seg id="2386">Over the past few months, a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is being used by many people to order them regularly in the future.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report about the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey on releasing his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone membrane that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the "personalities" that would make a stepford woman look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Realbotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex Robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed characters like "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of timidity and "Wild Wendy" with an adventurous personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is" "" "" "" "adapted to your personality" "" "" "", "enthuses the site of True Companion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "" "" "it can be tired to be fixed on conversation or it can be" in "" "" "" "mood" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if you go one step towards Frigid (here: reluctant) Farrah, upset one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website true Companion Roxxxy behaved with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it is said on the website.</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR records their increasing popularity, they remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the boundary zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear at a time when women's rights are threatened by women worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who pretends that women have been sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrifying aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid 's Tale' ('The report of the maid') is not the graphical pictures, the swallowed body and the extinct eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical likeness to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, brought to the point when it comes to their personalities, the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the fantasy of total subjugation.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to say it in the saying of 2017: maid girls</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a trump in the trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all ostensibly complaining to let our filter bubbles pop.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is in another context that it also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the gruselly possibility that his kittens will no longer be repaid us someday.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more difficult long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself being attacked today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of Crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump in fact occur to one as very mild criminal offense.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump passes, the next candidate of the Republican only need to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parkdepartment, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are cracked and the animals turn to look after their own shoulders - extremely gloomy and the music-pering music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite beyond the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Thematic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a large roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park-carousel is still a strange magical experience, as two-year-old, 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what is actually a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store stood outrageous, while I weary made the experience to reach her my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius relocated to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts in his wrists, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">He was sentenced to a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, throwing them on them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius said that he held his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder that hid herself in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to put an appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say she was too indulgent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the National Criminal Investigation Department said that she will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person concerned is usually advised to steer meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too long in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been discovered that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium takes tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their diet, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan will promote tolerant, less inflammatory bowel effects if the same system is also found in people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The Postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was kept separate, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbides of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri were able to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2623">How the wind turns out: when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked for Berlin with a certain concern before elections.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Merely no fire from the party headquarters, merely a headwind out of the League, was the most important wish of the election fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Since then, the employees from Willy Brandt's House are observing the events in the SPD-governed state capitals.</seg>
<seg id="2627">What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwind.</seg>
<seg id="2628">There were setbacks.</seg>
<seg id="2629">And one by one.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU faces a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"this shows once again: red-green can simply not govern reliably," said CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber, the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2632">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the surprising faction of a Greens deputies has overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2633">Five months before the Parliament election, his red-green coalition lost its one-votes majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.</seg>
<seg id="2634">The Green federal president, Michael Kellner, called on the apostolic Green deputies Elke Twesten to return her mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to the CDU signifies a clear distortion of the electorate's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Elke Twesten must immediately resign her mandate, "said the Federal President and Vice President of the Green Party Network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2637">"it must not be true at all," an SPD election warrior sighs when the new press message reaches the party centre on Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands for the CDU after the transition of green deputies to the CDU without his own majority.</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD's state associations.</seg>
<seg id="2640">And no one knows what comes next.</seg>
<seg id="2641">The Missing began with the unexpectedly clear defeat at the Saarland election in March.</seg>
<seg id="2642">A blue eye, no more, calmed the comrades at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.</seg>
<seg id="2644">And that's what it got - and everything became much worse.</seg>
<seg id="2645">The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a tumble, the Düsseldorf-Pleite snatched the party smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The comrades were laborious again in the weeks afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2647">Then, when they had just acquired new courage, the G-20 summit from Hamburg came.</seg>
<seg id="2648">And with him came the next draft.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD chief of the SPD, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.</seg>
<seg id="2650">And because in crisis communication he made quite everything wrong with what you can do wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Since then, Scholz is fighting for its political survival.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Now also Stephan Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2653">The prime minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time because of the VW-exhaust-atmosphere and its role in the supervisory board.</seg>
<seg id="2654">The survey values were added.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil tried to set accents in the Confederation over the past few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2656">The aspiration of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in the context of Martin Schulz.</seg>
<seg id="2657">They allowed him to be able to stabilise the party by Weil.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Now the exact opposite could happen.</seg>
<seg id="2659">In doing so, Weil finds no blame on the party-internal coercion of the lower Saxon Greens.</seg>
<seg id="2660">And Schulz at all.</seg>
<seg id="2661">For the time being, comrades, therefore, endeavour to keep its own ranks closed.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Their anger depends on the Greens, and here especially on the backsliding parliamentarian Twesten.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"it is unbearable and democratic, as Ms. Tester introduces her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, leader of the party leftist in the SPD Parliamentary Group, the German editorial network (RND).</seg>
<seg id="2664">Ms. Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person but on the national list of the Greens in Lower Saxony, so the Lower Saxon deputies continued.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "" "" "Thomas Oppermann, CEO of the SPD Parliamentary Group, complains of" "" "" "" "democratic maneuvers" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">"the voters' willingness four years ago was clear: people made Stephan Weil as prime minister," said Oppermann, who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as a leading candidate in the election of the Bundestag, the RND.</seg>

<seg id="2671">Funding for local cores III</seg>
<seg id="2672">Those who want to rehabilitate their house in the years can get support from the country in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives Steg City Development told about this on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information session, Schindler had once again a review of what has been happening.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been a lot of sanitation areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, recent renovations are a "successful project" - it is also important to promote inner development, not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received the information from the Government Presidency of Karlsruhe that there will be a refurbishment area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The funding amount was €833 333, of which €500 000 comes from the country, the rest of the congregation's feelings.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a sanitation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "one will, as Schindler further investigate, where the" "" "" "" "really old" "" "" "" houses "" "" "" "" houses are. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role if there is interest in the planned area at all to rehabilitate.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area boundaries could be postpone again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">The bridge was on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Keller presented the contents of the federal state programme "Social City," in which the restructurings would then be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Core of the program are the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, that is per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The renovation area would then eventually be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">Since 1 January 2017, the funding period for the subsidies runs until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">However, until September this year, the survey would take place only once, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire for filling out.</seg>
<seg id="2692">As soon as possible, in November or December, the statutory provisions will be made in order to begin with the restructurings in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann then declared that each commune must carry out the said preliminary examinations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is a question of evaluating and deciding on the extent to which the urban development is to be assessed and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will even come back to his senses and get a picture of the situation, promised them.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel affirmed that the project was a key success factor for the project.</seg>
<seg id="2698">This is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled in by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property sheet," which deals with the structural condition and the renovation views, among other things.</seg>
<seg id="2700">In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheets," information about the size, layout and residents of a living room can be made.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"" "" "" "the blue" "" "" "" "arc" "" "" "" "can only be filled when business premises are operated in the building." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2702">However, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire does not at the same time provide an application for funding.</seg>
<seg id="2703">In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler insisted that the distribution of the funding is functioning according to the "greyhound principle" - who comes first, first grind.</seg>
<seg id="2705">One could not reserve funding for later. "</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that raises the American production last month, taxpayers cost up to $24,000 according to the military's information given to the TIME magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, which was made in Connecticut, was on display next to a yacht from Maine, a petrol station from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy Commander of Marine for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 15 o'clock, and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the security staff remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 has asked if the event could hurt the appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," said the commander.</seg>

<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">At the event, the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes, is hardly a new phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and the South Lawn in order to suspend US President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">When Trump was at the G20 in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings in the White House.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not run budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Recording of the unit recorded the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers based on estimates of reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "" "" "" "said Walters." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not indulge in its persecution of Neymar after giving an offer of £189 million to trigger its release clauses, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">Following completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is furious about the way that Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalans state insisted that the club always did his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned of the PSG president three years ago before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Reporting on the misuse cases ratifies Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann means.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," explained after publication in relation to the German press agency, he was apologize from the former bishop of Regensburg and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Cathedral Choir Champion Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their profound regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano," on the other hand, criticised the fact that "double standards" are measured when reporting on violence in the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful deeds" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee, may be conspicuous.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and is preparing public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we would like to go to the church and that's a perfect fresher."</seg>
<seg id="2898">She also pointed out that in her youth "blows have been a quite normal educational tool," to be done with cheeky children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards for the past decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports of abuse, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann writes, who wrote the "My Brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I need to protect Georg Ratzinger," Ezekiel says, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber ordered with the Enlightenment at the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of transgressions, 67 domesticated cats.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality the punishment for the students could also be more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims said that a lot of victims rated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him in spite of violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Ezekne explains why the report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Ezekemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of exercise of violence on protective fighters at the Regensburger Domspatzen" are a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasise his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became tangible in the case of the oil, when a cathedral treasury has not brought any top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as a biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you still have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Eight pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or to have taken first hints not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "gymnasium" "" "" "" "on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents as" redemption "" "" "" "," "heaven" "" "" "" "and" better world. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also wrote an excellent testimony, describing it as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as a very good-natured teacher who regularly cared for the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which led to rage eruptions.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only knead with chairs and cast the keyring on the ground, but also drew ear tips and overlooked cheeky guys at the hair or ears, he had admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his rescue, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time, 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it actually is about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, they are of course bagatels.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not more with his familiarity and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In connection with the report, the media reported a great deal on the issue of misuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be charged in the final report any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Choir.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother," "" "" "" "said one of the affected," "" "" "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem of educating sexual abuse was, however, that most of the victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not for a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators to a professional degree.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do students assess Ratzinger's role in reducing abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioning pupil formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) could have had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben have more intrusive or clearer or even more open compared to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "" "" "the report concludes with the clear result:" "" "" "" "that he entrusted himself in the run-up to affected students and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the scope of the investigation." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free of any involvement.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he can't be accused of not preventing him or bringing him to display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was much to read about "non-violent eating" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "omission" in the report.</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and violent eating and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, there is a clear separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent eating, as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole awful test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were literally harassed and maltreated and suffered from them, took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions had to prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys to face when they were already on the site gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On this, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What else was different on the site gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but not a sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this is true also for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">Thus, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported of the conditions at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (thus the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger shut the ears consistently in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduces.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when punishments were banned in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably still knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the prison sentence was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians speak of the "pitfall of anachronism," that is, the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right now.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and also not for what has been breached in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all awful and I am happy that it will finally be worked up.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take protection from Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, that is, to pull ear tips and ears and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was banned, he was also strictly adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="2981">What picture of his time in Regensburg, Georg Ratzinger, has shown in our conversations with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test sentence also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about his brother Joseph's life, so Pope Benedict XVI said from his perspective, the Domspatzen just played a secondary role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not at all conceal that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trade, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, the rebellious boys will no longer be a great singer and before every success, regardless of the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the conversations with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I receive regular contact with him, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his emeritiation, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until today that he was once strict to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen is thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought the world of music to them.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look up and they downright venerate them.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly, all that is presented to him are the methods of education that were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is only too obvious the evil intent behind it.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published ratifies it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the lawyer would command a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits, and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
