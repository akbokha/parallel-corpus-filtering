28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went uphill again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , told the geri@@ at@@ ric ward in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations underway .
brother of the sacrifice , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS broad@@ ca@@ ster K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; shocked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over his death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank was initially living in host@@ els but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shared Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his way of combining with his family was to cook for us always something to prepare for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that brigh@@ tly lighted every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information in the event will be asked to call the notice phone of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has now clearly made it clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged in drawers or stuck from the outside label that usually has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather sn@@ u@@ ff to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of TVs with lo@@ cker@@ ish de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for white blood it brings the question of the desire for a child : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not Child &apos;s Play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on 25th August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses reminded themselves of their celebrations , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p back home to the fe@@ ed@@ stuff .
one kilometer at that pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and that was the end of the riding career .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament wins - again near horses .
he had his family run over the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and there@@ with also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala , the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no shortage of acc@@ ol@@ ades to the li@@ ke@@ able ath@@ lete .
Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen had already beg@@ ged him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting junior staff .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; on Saturday .
the performers include the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the true Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Roger @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports le@@ agues came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lau@@ re@@ ate Prize was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - we want Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ divided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical difference .
about the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , &quot; he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will go down substantially , and he &apos;s strong for a far @-@ reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfill , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open up and needs money for it .
that is why taxes would increase for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the US , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost verb@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state @-@ critical te@@ ap@@ party wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so on Tr@@ ump there could still be party @-@ internal discussions .
the differences in energy and climate policies are more significant .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA .
oil production is also to be possible in protected areas , and he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection treaty .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend the renewable energy with its investment programme and demands : &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the same time both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but rather protect American jobs better . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be paid better , e.g. Clinton says .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger wage .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ end , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his critics cont@@ end him , so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand Clinton , who wants to demand at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
escape : &quot; every woman who fled has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at most one year old .
one has put her little son in her arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she smil@@ ed briefly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Business Manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alized accommodations for single @-@ wing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs worked together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s help .
recently it was officially opened .
there are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death or because their families send them as a ray of hope to Europe , &quot; she says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ors , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the tu@@ gs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
anyone who believes that the end as soon as they come to Germany ir@@ re tells us .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst mis@@ used .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the shelter in the north of Munich are traumati@@ zed , she appreci@@ ates .
&quot; some of the children did not come up voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what has been experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodations only for them , B@@ ahr says .
in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
some say no to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in lodging of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , even wing@@ ed women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses in some community shel@@ ters only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Committee also calls for women to be shel@@ tered from men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if privacy is missing , men and women are housed together , there can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily , in the study .
how much women feel this need for protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since she has been talking about us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new work @-@ fighting measures
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistant doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their dispute regarding a new contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that ministers would have agreed to address the concerns of the contract . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in July , assistance physicians and medical students agreed to the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in favour of the elections .
in a letter to the members published on Thursday evening on Twitter , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have had problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official re @-@ negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Board has today submitted a formal application for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating action measures starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to the first general failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistance physicians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 medical students and medical students , that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile was ru@@ de and he barely radi@@ ated heat , even for his re@@ tic@@ ent circumstances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke about his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper compl@@ ained that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as though something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the dow@@ ning of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was ramp@@ ant .
Putin in@@ sti@@ gated and accused Ankara to fall into his back .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was done by a supposed friend .
to re @-@ establish ne@@ sts becomes difficult if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
the serious accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s territories , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan desper@@ ately needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat of almost his office .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
tour operators and charter companies in Russia will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season rush to the Mediterranean .
this week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were once again allowed .
a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti put it in the following words : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it regards the response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
to this end , the continued res@@ ent@@ ment on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pi@@ er@@ ced to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West .
the Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders , &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that are torn off from the West and feel badly treated and are now alli@@ ed .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents stated at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the issue .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey ou@@ sted the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least again .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
according to the Chief Executive Officer of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand is only to be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national brands .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and the stock exchange listing on Nat@@ west will change .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I say now that we have no global goals , but pursue local goals .
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own congregations and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer be able to continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s time for us to become a bank of the brands , because how do we focus on the interior ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think that you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne for a double at New@@ market , who brings it 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market on Friday .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey that reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar in front of it , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori raises the che@@ er when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career flights
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in modern times and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone , which only a few have achieved before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect , which distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for this kind of sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6.000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has been ri@@ dden in the UK for nearly 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying @-@ Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban .
three years ago , he had trouble initially when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of Putin &apos;s cra@@ mp@@ ed trust in many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is said that without giving reasons , Putin ordered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in Tokyo &apos;s embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it means ( in Russian ) that he was later the log@@ isti@@ cal officer and manager of the government personnel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin told Russian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the narrow@@ est confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he stands for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
during a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff rec@@ edes on his own request .
but despite the s@@ miles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
so is the consequence of a kind of struggle for power ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president who would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said &quot; It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - placing an equivalent post for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin reached power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another close ally close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ ons from the series , which is followed by a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played at the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od over the past twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled to take place on September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be about 75 fish around sandals that have been blown out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope hoping that someone might throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Royal Crossing : bridge Conn@@ ected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the northern deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
it is the first of four closures of the &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge .
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017 .
economic minister Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witness@@ ing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
a total of almost 79 % of the deck &apos;s deck is located at its place and the last section of the deck is given today in Ros@@ y@@ th a concrete nut for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking portrait and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the gap already existing on the north or the north side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive yet very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off at Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swimming in safety while their boat moved from their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat coming close to us and presented the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of reach , until we left the water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bo@@ ar without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue @-@ boots and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat motor had an emergency stop , it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controlled the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
hard hurt - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police ha@@ st@@ ened yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic bl@@ ender cuts the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she entered the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by his hand and body .
the police could arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companions .
she met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ companion on the street .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who is building low @-@ priced flats in Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; investors should be much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Brun@@ swi@@ ck will lose nearly 1300 apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; room for action &quot; at the next meeting .
but disputes are programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas in the future must show 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stocks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development programme , which will cost millions of costs and still needs to be financed , is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the problem is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er print runs for investors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter how viol@@ a , a tigh@@ tening of the situation is on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the concept of action is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the roughly 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how can you compensate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments whose funding will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to planner Nicole Palm , plans for planning are now to be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back into the price fixing .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
this is because in the west city the dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price fixing for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the housing associations .
for if the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically again , the aim of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare is to be removed .
there should be no concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens expect there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go by boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus was on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that te@@ ens and children no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time watching TV screens , has been accused of many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time at the screen was initially on TV , then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive .
I &apos;m obviously referring to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a series of animations , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
how many pop culture phenomena sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the boat and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the United States , the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person re@@ stores each day .
Car@@ di@@ hat , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 35@@ ,000 users , recently told Washington Post that within two days after market launch , the number of tra@@ cked people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks at the raw data for improving performance .
many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; to &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; and &quot; being active every day &quot; hit the de@@ af ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people looking mis@@ erable .
nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone exercising sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it helps people to do something outside that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also spo@@ iler bum@@ pers , who always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished over time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es Cre@@ ates gold in Dam@@ age Valley
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breath taking place on the ground .
brilliant on a whole line .
and now finally Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ki@@ cked off on Thursday for a multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ team @-@ k@@ amer@@ adi@@ n A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ afa .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es cul@@ min@@ ates on the balance beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and the fifth as she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had ended at that very moment .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the past three years , 15 World Championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited them a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between it and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign women of the women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday as she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the f@@ arewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed on never having planned the future during their long march , this is not really true .
part of her soil exercises - which contain her typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coinci@@ dence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion to the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man trained , became the force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition in the competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Must@@ afa was easily led by two rot@@ ations , the picture dec@@ ei@@ led .
Swedish lum@@ ber and floor gymn@@ as@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the world champion title - lu@@ red .
she resum@@ ed again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still sat on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her final funeral - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured out on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ afa .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team capit@@ ulated who is called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans .
after her tur@@ mo@@ il she threw the crowd into the crowd , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims killed in a series of mur@@ der@@ ers while listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix as they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm as he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed mainly in His@@ panic residential areas within four months and two more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , told the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n .
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they had concluded that the attacks were linked and that the same mur@@ derer has been committed .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ ital@@ ised because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also issued a police report on the shooting that was zi@@ pped to an empty pickup truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the work of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but as the f@@ ew@@ est of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Micro@@ c@@ ep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do it .
I don &apos;t manage it .
wher@@ eu@@ pon I did not let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested institution@@ alizing it .
&quot; my first answer to this was &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained .
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a sal@@ ute .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News said .
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a wide range of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the ci@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked constantly what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still does not know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful suggestion for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives cause for rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy ra@@ ins and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the state of emergency on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected congregations .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone had claimed tens of thousands of sand sacks .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in the rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday , while in the Mobile area it was still ra@@ ining .
the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a stream @-@ downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger since they will only flow slowly over the tro@@ dden rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w river , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
b@@ ail@@ out teams still attacked people from flood waters in the Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son districts in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved by glo@@ om on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , rose greatly over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water poured and poured in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the han@@ di@@ caps and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were lod@@ ged until Friday .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said the flood was spreading rapidly , as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation directions .
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer came near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floods caused the res@@ cu@@ ing of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and the excursion in five school districts .
the C@@ BS affiliate WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 in@@ und@@ ated buildings .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which now both were in@@ und@@ ated .
the rec@@ tor of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller told that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven domestic animals washed from floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once the water starts to go back , they will return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , who hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emer@@ ald manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy des Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to be floo@@ ded on Thursday , but there were no reports on Friday .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; perfor@@ ated by balls , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police tell us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a six @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot violations , including in the waist , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital during his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was perfor@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared the broad@@ ca@@ ster . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the condition of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the transmitter that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable condition .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical state , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
according to C@@ BS Philadelphia , investig@@ ators told them that there had apparently come to a cross@@ fire between several arch@@ ers .
cartridge tubes for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ saw the crime scene .
it seems that this was clearly an ongoing battle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were sleeves .
so it seems to have given here several armed fighters , who were very active involved , &quot; distributed police agents Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the broad@@ ca@@ ster .
several houses and vehicles have also been hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing reports according to the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross b@@ lower at her arm as she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine in the gymn@@ as@@ tics club in the gymn@@ as@@ tics club and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ esses , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls from other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Co@@ cian , the Catholic , rounds off , makes everyone proud .
this team is finally mirr@@ oring the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female female Tur@@ ner was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ led Olympic champion and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez offering unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual female American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see sports classes anywhere in the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all hit the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to join the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymn@@ asts in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer .
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily invest in private gy@@ ms , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to give inspiration to the churches au@@ n countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible exercise .
I have founded my Foundation for 20 years .
in my events , we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban you@@ ths ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international champi@@ ons .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body , as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and scho@@ oling and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true depic@@ tion of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the wood of the Olympic team gold and thanks , you get motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians voted in favour of a vote rejected it .
in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty , saying that the N@@ HS was found in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first physicians should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend stays in order to improve the care at times of irregular time .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assistance physicians announced last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current crisis of the workforce and to treat it to meet all the doctors . &quot;
in only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out .
efforts by the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through dialogue met with the government on reluc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , raise the condition and address the cares of the assistance physicians . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he fails to do so , the doctors made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work @-@ fighting measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to cover doctors on the Strip .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA wants a better week remuneration for the 5@@ 4,000 common physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employee , called on the doctors to stop the strike .
Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work @-@ fighting measures do not reach a minimum , but already burden un@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , car@@ egi@@ vers and their families only worry , need and interruption . &quot;
in the last two months , we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and had a positive response to concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time@@ frame , training days , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training vac@@ ations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers , the Health Education United Kingdom and the Ministry of Health were in compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form coverings .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause blood cl@@ ots that clo@@ g the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots are released , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the N@@ ICE line draft , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture blos@@ som@@ ing blos@@ som@@ ing in Muslim areas
last year the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office because of corruption .
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread voting fraud in Muslim municipalities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and city coun@@ cils to have ignored the evidence of election ab@@ uses due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption emperor , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside election cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in elections .
at the moment a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader base of corruption and financial fraud , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special judgment ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a lit@@ any .
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation where one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric stated that there was evidence in the whole country for fraud .
he expressed in particular alar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - the elder members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including performing ID cards to prove the identity
in his report it says : &quot; evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there have been concerns ... government institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensi@@ tivities regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban on political activists to process letter selection to stop &quot; election harvest . &quot;
the report considered by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration verification to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once it has released its voice to prevent someone to choose twice .
carry out systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting .
prohibition that political activists deal full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of local elections .
the police have the authority to set up barriers for election stations .
a change in the law which resulted in an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
ban on photography in election stations .
requirement that only English should be used in the election stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally en@@ force that voters walk alone in the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let case , there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any on corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons for sufficient - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country , as the Mother of Parliament , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T with the exception of margin and volume , which has proved to be an impressive du@@ chess of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic champion is by far not the only athle@@ tic warri@@ or who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe social media .
in honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently fli@@ ck@@ ering on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that have more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .

the team member of the US squ@@ ad in bow shooting Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks ak@@ ily like the wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ anity in social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see no great simil@@ arity except the facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one passage higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ er
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal @-@ float Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair such as the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans to resem@@ ble an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet is thinking that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar visual form and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons covered K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ne Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200@@ 0s fre@@ est@@ yle swimming @-@ aff@@ el puts his own opinions .
Mac@@ don@@ ald , who had been brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
excit@@ edly , as he called M@@ ief , he died like a pig .

spectators all over Canada quickly re@@ acted online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ ce twe@@ et@@ ers , &quot; Does the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; died &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , many of which were talking to him .
Twitter users did not stop when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; w@@ ow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # raised .
a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast , was re@@ inde@@ b@@ ted live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; We ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming performance aired . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it has happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with people responding to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Rus@@ sell had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ is@@ sending . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged over women tried in the middle of business sham@@ eless under@@ wear
the buyers didn &apos;t know where to look , when a woman left her clothes in the middle of a mark to try under@@ pants .
to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman ta@@ sted the under@@ pants before putting them back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in store at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , she went back and went out of business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she picked up a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , since she put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she did not like anything , and went out and went out .
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b anyone observing - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had ta@@ sted . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how dispro@@ por@@ tionally to think that someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I got along , the employees tried to pull garments out of sale after it went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9th August at our office in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself against attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at the distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer against your pre@@ dat@@ or .
if you look at you from behind you should turn yourself first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
hit it then with your knee in the l@@ ath and twist while the attack@@ er cur@@ bs against pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the weapon and twist them so that the aggres@@ sor cannot shoot .
at the same time , shift weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon on it .
does it sound difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it performs Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est to hand over your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ els his tongue on the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller underwent a serious test of his immune system and th@@ row@@ er , taking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k turned his train on a Euro note , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before checking every object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of de@@ cking the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things .
from public hand@@ rails to stations to r@@ ins@@ ing toilets , the task definitely put his immune system under a rehear@@ sal
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , soil , worms and mud . &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample painting showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to check after its lumin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 units .
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to what I have cleaned in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ inous than that !
I won &apos;t lick here anything because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
vali@@ o Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new .
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Give us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet shown in the movie . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to set them up and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all poll@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung Social @-@ Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social home after a del@@ o@@ dation with a loss of £ 50,000 because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed plain@@ tive holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn open , garbage was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared onto the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private accomodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted on street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive cri@@ es , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden boards were torn apart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing hired her and her partner viol@@ ently from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to withdraw .
the del@@ o@@ dation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were not afraid of anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years apart from them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
now that they are gone , it will become beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years long
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the village house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see would agree to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ o@@ dation is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horri@@ ble .
I appreciate all the work done by my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police as well as members of the community who have bol@@ dly approached us and have provided the information to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ dation on the ground .
house@@ keeping workers will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don got a fine , after she found herself guilty of ow@@ ning a class B drug in commercial view .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti dau@@ bed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said that she will be a rent@@ ers who will not abide by the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ dation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet is flying over
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on airplane of the Air Force put an unbelievable crash landing
the Air Force announced that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no security risk .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost within reach of the sun @-@ wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers arose when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ ent@@ abra@@ werke , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic F@@ ly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane would fall down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and flying so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the poor visibility due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety was at no time at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , with four people coming to death on Madeira Island .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - limiting its visibility .
the aircraft was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify fis@@ her boats as part of the exercise .

after that he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang with only 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the unexpected match didn &apos;t develop .
but nevertheless , sufficiently breathtaking ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an had contracted a ri@@ b injury , followed by medical treatment , had to settle &quot; in the end &quot; with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have , by the way , become Olympic @-@ Fourth .
Donald Tr@@ ump clean up ″ Major Problems ″ in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditionally conservative national states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted weaknesses of his electoral campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confi@@ dently occurring mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire vo@@ iced something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after he has thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts pers@@ ist in his success in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in major states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to blame for false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
w@@ ob@@ ble republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ States in June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were upset by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump at the front , but not with the distance that is common for republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he does not do anything other than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to cut mon@@ ies to support its electoral campaign , it should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead , the Republi@@ cans &apos;s candidates for Congress would be stronger than the poor .
Olympia : three Sc@@ am at Dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Jan@@ eiro Olympics in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
Kenya has sent a coach home after an attempt at dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village .
the International Olympic Committee immediately informed a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary announced that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave an Ur@@ ine trial in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich .
this was reported to the Ken@@ yan team of dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , a IA@@ AF speaker announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the study and the measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will carry out an evaluation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , who submitted and signed the sample , &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Chief of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the ath@@ lete &apos;s accreditation , which was on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing &apos;s World Cup fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been removed from the Rio games .
he is said to have informed the athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was arrested at his return to Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation since a long time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was unusual beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the beginning of Olympia .
in consequence , the WA@@ DA Kenya gained from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control con@@ forms to the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the World Cup in Beijing in 2015 .
in a series of television reports , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sport fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und requested a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this sport type has been systematically sub@@ du@@ ed and systematically supp@@ ressed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in Shakespeare &apos;s year , the Salzburg Festival expl@@ ores the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple like Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ verk@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary .
the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an Con@@ duc@@ tor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ms .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have amber music really in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members with nostal@@ gia her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it &apos;s wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Roman , &quot; Bart@@ oli laughs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
she is an enormously large person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern tem@@ per , a fire , a passion and also a happy approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , back then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want to .
they are the same issues , and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girls who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
she was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sult@@ ana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London rose to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and she became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton is going to be a candidate for the Supreme Court in the case of electoral victory at Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the Republi@@ can candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the confirmation of Gar@@ lands since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate of Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ ena .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if he would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he was spec@@ ulating .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not care for un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the U.S. App@@ eals Court for the District of Columbia .
RAID said re@@ public@@ ans block@@ ed the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and assistant heroes of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with photographer David Bell@@ me@@ ere to bring out a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked humans they would like to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine is different from old school play@@ boys , as Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the opinion that the calendar also does .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of Cal@@ endar@@ s .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; those who do not adapt to Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany at short notice .
in the medium term , it could even become &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; the president &apos;s president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , believes .
due to the harsh star@@ vation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president &apos;s president , Ali Top@@ ra@@ k , the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already covered Kurdish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal charges several months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the dec@@ ei@@ ving put@@ sch , there are still secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks .
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that absor@@ bs refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the Association depl@@ ored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in provincial cities .
in this way , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the expression on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or driven out over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said , who is also a CD@@ U member .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he demanded that the German government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; is taking place against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire marking as Gü@@ len adher@@ ents destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who do not adapt and bury Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and Sa@@ ws , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ Ne@@ ar Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the newspaper , calling on figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already set up the largest group of authorized people in Germany because of political persecution before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , these were 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people , and thus nearly 29 percent of all recognized as asylum seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no need for war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum Rights under the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. on the state side , individual prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the parliament .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
until the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament elections will not be held again until the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year .
because it &apos;s not stupid to date : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bit@@ es .
the natives , who are to be persu@@ aded by the election fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on the way to Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not natives , so you can &apos;t choose the holiday .
practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , air ballo@@ ons infl@@ ate , fl@@ yers and end up counting , only lab@@ orious .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again let the people go over themselves .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear for his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tions .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels through the country , distri@@ butes ros@@ ses and ch@@ ats a bit with the people , just as it already happened to his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
apart from that , sailors have got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel is bl@@ amed for the Af@@ D &apos;s blos@@ som@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ha@@ st@@ ened the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which probably will cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes electoral campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale r@@ allies . the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the northeast .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; there was probably the majority of other German states , &quot; compl@@ ained Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR .
but it also regre@@ ts no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U largely disp@@ enses with the usual election campaigns on market@@ places and in front of m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons .
this , so says Kok@@ ert , plays only a subordin@@ ate role . &quot;
also the Union noticed that in the country you ro@@ de the base , that it must be very demanding to find again a wire to the people .
you are on the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens , hardly available in the sides of the country .
the advice of the CD@@ U @-@ vot@@ er Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , S@@ ella has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ stly at 22 percent behind the CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the 2011 election , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holiday need and largely transfer their election campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online campaign fight , &quot; calls it the pres@@ idents Claudia Müller .
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for local stimul@@ ants among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ vy with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; electoral holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Rest@@ oration : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5 : 30 a.m. and end at about 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; they have done everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station .
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be finished .
the commen@@ cement of the work carried out for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for instance when it comes to the establishment of expe@@ ditions .
since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the block@@ age of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is restored , the traffic situation within the village has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the journey through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were some serious complaints , &quot; says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ son had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some lor@@ ries fran@@ ken in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community increased the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were significant exc@@ esses , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself .
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fast track was around 77 hours per hour in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to a break in revenues makes anyone who asks you to look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
those who have less to do with the end customer , so for other companies , have hardly any consequences for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the search engine lacks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the locals are the most sa@@ w@@ ed along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
the sales revenue figures rise to &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the road renovation has cast its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his staff .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous is handled .
at all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history .
it can be understood that other regular guests are less often passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance .
if you can &apos;t go there , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his regular client@@ ele comes back after the end of the renovation work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly bol@@ ted to laws .
following the recent attacks , Home Secretary de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what does a winding state have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the conci@@ erge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; politically reasonable &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior during the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they do not demand anyone .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also participated in this .
as Minister of the Interior , however , he was at the results and at a &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; within the Coalition .
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has allowed a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , p@@ onder@@ ed : that a new security agency should take care of the cris@@ p of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU requirements on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second attempt on proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty , and jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship need to kno@@ ck down the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he nevertheless holds this for reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère presents a few new ideas as well .
they have it partly in themselves : he is planning rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are currently recru@@ ited in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check .
in case of den@@ ounc@@ ements for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of them are politically and legally sacred .
some of them still have an unpleasant impact and leave questions un@@ answered .
and at some points - in the case of un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it is not possible to say that the Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg assass@@ ins were refugees .
in addition , given the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that people deeply occupied were not to be cl@@ ung out in election campaigns .
the inner security has enormously moved into the focus .
first the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are campaigns .
therefore , the Union and the SPD are increasingly coming to terms with the issue of inner security .
in the past few days , between the two parties it was high .
it was only a gar@@ ris@@ tic dispute over the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers , in which the department chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
he doesn &apos;t think of a return from the double pass .
we satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ discover it is not expe@@ dient .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
whether its own package is constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner must first show itself .
there is a lot of things that could cause a quar@@ rel .
however , the SPD is currently attempting to profile itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still gli@@ ding in gli@@ mps .
despite diesel scar@@ ves , delivery numbers are increasing worldwide .
but it does not work in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tices around a term .
Volkswagen ki@@ cks off in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July , the VW brand was weaker especially in Western Europe and once again exposed aggregate sales , as reported by the company in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars .
in Western Europe alone , after China became the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
deliveries increased by almost one sixth in the home market of Germany .
head of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July , above all , to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic environment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on exit from the EU also stressed that a spokes@@ woman explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the USA , where the exhaust air has first escal@@ ated , a minus is also to be found .
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , Nieder@@ sachsen imp@@ acted by the diesel sc@@ andal . after the first seven months , only an ex@@ tradition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent is expected to be sold to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales place from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust test .
in Germany alone VW inv@@ okes about 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after conversion of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
after the conversion , the car manufacturer asked the customer a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as stated on Friday in business trips .
reason are legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now providing a guarantee for diesel models that have been retro@@ fitted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion will not result in any deterioration and all type approval @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
Volkswagen , however , does not use the term &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was stated in business trips .
with the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen is able to see , for example , a half year after the conversion , for example , a engine failure in a workshop - and that could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest it is important to avoid that if any other damages which have nothing to do with the sc@@ andal @-@ off sc@@ andal , such uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations is as stated .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands pen@@ al interest from rich savers - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay for their austerity pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks deposit money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund back in September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 Euros will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; said Paul .
for some time , he was be@@ ware of 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and generate a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank manager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for each million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he now passes on the costs after the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
the cash simply lying in the v@@ aults of Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four cases already , I don &apos;t even want the fifth ! , &quot; said the Bank board .
most customers would have understanding and exchange on other investment forms .
only a few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Co@@ operative Association declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs at all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically viable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with a penalty interest of three million euros .
Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking association , said : &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay nationwide fees for deposits , and the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele that is a bit more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they tend to pay money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other banks are currently known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cooperative association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that charge a compensation for private clients &quot; deposits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen banks ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards the private customer is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle aged love plates .
before comm@@ itting to the comment section , in order to re@@ ap him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non @-@ Alle@@ e men &apos;s middle @-@ age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement deri@@ ves from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widely discussed re@@ development of records is not attributable to a boom in millenni@@ als that want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but on Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently purchased a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age of 45 and 54 .
indeed , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby @-@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog is a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and shaking wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something better : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still remains a handful of fantastic record specialist shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of Files : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , do I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says .
I have about 3,000 or 4.000 boards .
these records , shown above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford when he appeared and once more buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media p@@ addle , people who heard about the com@@ eback and set themselves to buy their old records again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have dump@@ ed their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to supporters of the record high@@ test of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record shops offer a soothing union of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers stum@@ bled on the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that recall lucky youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is something for me as a collector so I think it &apos;s like many people .
it is a simple way to mentally deal with .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee fli@@ rts with a record stack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that nearly 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have turn@@ tables .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while stro@@ lling through a stack of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Date : three men of middle ages ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone only came here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ rich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gram@@ ophone records , has a lower audience than I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ t@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz we@@ ars out of the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks wei@@ rd but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are hard to detect if you stand alongside someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping @-@ shopping than a big shopping @-@ buy .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives off with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression of wearing je@@ ans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items is more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as records .
even though my research suggests that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , they dis@@ regard the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their th@@ urs@@ day morning with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates as they avoid the star@@ ing gaze of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who rises above the shoulders of susp@@ ecting middle @-@ aged men .

French court dis@@ claims offer on demoli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in mak@@ es@@ hi@@ ft restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would have a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported feder@@ ations and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille ruled that there would be no legal basis for expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the places that was threatened by the tear @-@ down was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is self @-@ serving and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children of whom the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help refugees and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of living in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .

he must analyze in quiet@@ ness what reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we &apos;ve changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up beam that specializes in this hobby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much money flows for the tak@@ eover , Microsoft didn &apos;t share with it on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Be@@ am started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also grab yourself .
for example , they can give players missions and counter@@ pose enemies and provide equipment .
the Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard is launching a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up team , who had its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customers .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video game section around the Xbox console according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video game activities is growing rapidly .
known Plat@@ forms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was purchased by the online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google @-@ mother alphab@@ et .
here comes the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which are to be implemented particularly effectively .
the futur@@ istic Enfor@@ cement trailers from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in the areas of accident , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed police , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a steady speed limit for compliance with speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation ; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as travel b@@ ans by time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
to ensure that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also shrink @-@ proof outer cover disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is intended to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 items last year .
Britain ob@@ tains Silver in 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji takes Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final on Thursday evening in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the Flo@@ od Stadium .
Fi@@ ji made a master class in handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ down , line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of this , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , former chief of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of G@@ Bs from fun .
it felt like the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell on and Co. started as if you were running in running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 upwards when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was in the corner .
with only four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right hand corner .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua drove a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ i@@ des through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
it &apos;s as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still lear@@ ns .
this is how it is .
GB led basic changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South S@@ in sul@@ try , whose fans sang , flags p@@ add@@ led and d@@ anced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle ring , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and ki@@ cked crus@@ hing in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scar@@ ce semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown took the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ king by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured winning - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer for rowing win
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ eric gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first stro@@ kes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
although it was only the con@@ dol@@ es sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was ever present when they ru@@ ined the second Olympic gold in the second without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that set such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 000 useless effort , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the nature of the trium@@ ph@@ al procession .
behind each gold in the row there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and nobody knew whether he would survive this day if he was diagnosed with cancer this day .
as he said , he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was fortunate that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the interruption to a minimum , if it is at all the right term .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet , 30 foot , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ rising morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
p@@ anning , which was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . this is perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much this means to me how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thanks go to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with .
even in the last 500 metres , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , there were too much reserve and glo@@ ver in reserve .
we were very much captured at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking to make something happen .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , what we did .
the couple will take a time out for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
it took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small , Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for large water producers .
some time ago it was said in the original sound in a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
little later , the water forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken appreciated the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ties group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was a member of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband from 31 years , stands for 28 years as managing director .
now he retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , annually supports approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the commun@@ es are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was hired as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Bet@@ ter Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organisational skills , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions , to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events she called for the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and the compensation of the farmers , the restoration of the high containers ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the re@@ modelling of water pipes .
there was no stand@@ still , and new additions have always been added , because water means living and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation she praised Go@@ ehr@@ er &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has used much lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he has literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ dos@@ stein@@ gruppe to the nit@@ rate sin@@ king before the water forum of the Unter@@ fran@@ ken districts .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on his side , praised Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water go@@ ver and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the bur@@ gl@@ ary at the elevated tank at Kirch@@ hof on a 3rd of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n , because one filled the high container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open to the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago is well ahead and now I &apos;m learning privately in New York , where there are the best therap@@ ists .
&quot; to give an example : if I ask him something that comes back two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko .
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est person on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass @-@ bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .
she is now married to the ten@@ or Y@@ usi@@ f Ey@@ v@@ az@@ ov .
relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at life partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 a.m. and injured it mort@@ ally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has inv@@ oked himself with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , and after him , he was publicly punished .
in the meantime , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police published a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police .
those who see Sven S. shall call the 110 .
the police speak of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to give any information about the course or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a man had been killed .
&quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special case command ( SE@@ K ) was at the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions .
the table is financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production .
the German Federal Economics Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) said : &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only if the generators in the ste@@ el@@ works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent will fall .
but even this is not raised in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on the production of electricity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the status quo of the previous regulation is thus largely fixed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of emissions trading , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered from over@@ capacity since the financial crisis of 2008 and a considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers in China threw a mass of steel on the world market in the face of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing Chinese steel groups .
in the course of this spring the situation got a little relaxed .
on the one hand , aff@@ i@@ xed import duties have an effect on import steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , the prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp aimed not to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel manufacturers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
with 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Division announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced volume went back to the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association expects an increase in output thanks to an improved order situation in the coming months .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her entire life to Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the teacher training college , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels well @-@ balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and mind .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
at the same time , sen@@ iors exercise deep and controlled breathing .
he who regularly demands his lungs gets out of the d@@ olls even in everyday life .
singing is an optimal hobby , even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age .
for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ur@@ sul@@ a L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Organisation of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through song lyrics and especially melodies , even dementia patients are ab@@ sin@@ king for long @-@ lying events .
while singing , a special performance is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate simultaneously on one &apos;s voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem increases through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for something for a long time , I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are plenty of good reasons to start singing .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior champi@@ on@@ or , one can simply join .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul good and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to every age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males at cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , what effect the calling of cat babies has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the m@@ owing also did not let the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the reg@@ ression degree of cat bab@@ ys on the m@@ owing of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to the lu@@ te of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great distress , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - though always the same .
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between ow@@ ning less and strongly arous@@ ed young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from MH@@ H .
it is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous examination the team of researchers found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ@@ ed with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a rep@@ el of little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger raised k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
despite the low sample for meaningful results , the researchers maintain their results .
&quot; all the females , even those who didn &apos;t have their own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding .
they turned around faster to the loudspeaker , when this calls were played by the very reg@@ ather@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ ologist said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds .
some studies showed that women responded more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann informed .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kat@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kat@@ r in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
already with the im@@ position of the state of emergency following the overthrow of July in July the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not to be affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no stop before football .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ kat@@ r .
accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ kat@@ r is to be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
true , the state of emergency , suspended for 90 days , is still valid until October , but in reality most Turks do not have any impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the noc@@ tur@@ nal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what unites the indignation of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
at the tro@@ phy winner &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski .
the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all cont@@ ests , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first playing time as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and his team secured the cup .
thanks to Pol@@ di , the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
after the round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also leave early in the Europa League .
in the Sü@@ per Li@@ g there was only sixth place .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win anything .
&quot; we managed this , and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski .
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sten @-@ King laid the foundation for the 14th title .
this is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the AC @-@ Florence , the Gom@@ ez rented at the AC @-@ Florence had only been announced after the coup attempt , because of the political situation in the country after his European vac@@ ations .
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say , &quot; he quoted the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; Club Princip@@ al Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man .
to do so , however , the stri@@ ker must be willing to ren@@ ounce about a third of his annual salary of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have med@@ als chance at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova cannot start in Rio .
other hand @-@ held athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing continues to be the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had filed their initial right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was pi@@ ped out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters chest ) and rested .
a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery was offered : with a s@@ miles she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a whi@@ rl@@ wind .
but there are still many other sports@@ men going to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Olympic Games in Rio .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion has even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to take a six @-@ month lock in 2010 , after she was detected the ing@@ es@@ tion of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after an operation she had severe tooth@@ ache , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ends herself .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion was tested positive for the banned stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tiveness and was locked for six months .
the four most popular lit@@ ters this year are due to the great gold fav@@ ori@@ tin account .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Peking Olympic Champion and two @-@ time World Champion over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months .
a penis enlargement remedy has been responsible for ped@@ alling .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many med@@ als detected afterwards .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having been determined with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid drugs and the 2006 European Championship because of testosterone deficiency .
he also recognized the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record driver and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but must nevertheless start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champi@@ onships clu@@ es were found on taking a forbidden dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency WA@@ DA ble@@ w mil@@ dly and ran already on July 13th .
bom@@ bing terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but I could leave it again .
she planned her home@@ ward journey for the beginning of September .
it is still unclear whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket and in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities .
the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up again , another human being killed according to the authorities .
a bomb explosion was also reported from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in the det@@ onation , near the bathing beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular among holi@@ day@@ makers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban workers .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast police .
after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast demanded several injuries .
one goes from a relationship with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ om@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to comment on possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather estimated that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta have been laid .
the authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country over the past few days - but they did not have been informed of the exact time and place .
it is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but most of the time they are not against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Thailand &apos;s king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the present bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Office recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ far@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations , unnecessary trips are not carried out in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence also in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , re@@ members itself to restore stability and order to the kingdom .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Legal Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several provincial offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the League put the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; Identi@@ t@@ arian Movement &apos; indications of aspir@@ ations against the Free Democratic Prin@@ ciples , &quot; said the director Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß , the German Press Agency in Berlin .
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
this is why we now observe the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
constitutional guards in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ als . &quot;
Ma@@ demo@@ s said that his authority was closely coordinated with the provincial offices during the decision .
&quot; groups like the &quot; identical movement &quot; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Princip@@ al .
extre@@ mi@@ sts generally try to address them in a you@@ thful language , often with pop music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to address people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
most recently , there have been reports from several German states on the contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ t@@ aries &quot; to the Af@@ D politicians .
Ma@@ demo@@ s said that he has no knowledge .
for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , and so becomes extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
with a view to the marked increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee camps , Ma@@ aß said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this context .
but in recent years we have noticed that there can be legally @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the &apos; Frei@@ tal Group &apos; .
it may well be that there are other righ@@ tist groups or small groups that are planning attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of right @-@ wing terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks .
worried , Ma@@ demo@@ s expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before .
this is wor@@ rying .
many of the suspi@@ cious attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences , which previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which might have been politically in@@ different or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always , the Olympic Games or the World Records are the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Summer Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghty s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were sw@@ am so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then promoted to viral interaction .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries better known .
as most sports@@ men walk in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot;
following a &quot; prosperity b@@ ump , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; The Sun &quot; made fun with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; about him .
his time , he kno@@ cked at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ est@@ yle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i led the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea bu@@ oy@@ ancy , when he had to stand alone in a preliminary run over 100 metres of Fre@@ est@@ yle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a shop at Neues Platz had been fo@@ aled .
according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 17.@@ 30 a.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor .
when she came back on the next morning at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock , about 250 euro disappeared from the cas@@ hier .
traces of the perpet@@ r@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
tr@@ ump sees the im@@ pending election defeat not so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump is already an alternative video .
he then asc@@ ends into vacation .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , he doesn &apos;t care about it : &quot; ultimately , it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he thus described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
postal enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other firms on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicles Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the postal service will also be offering its electric v@@ ans on the free car market from the coming year onwards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter third parties for sale , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been examining for months whether they want to sell their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ des had said that there are always post @-@ questions , e.g. by craftsmen .
according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly .
in post @-@ production manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust move towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership to dis@@ appoint after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Consumer Research Group G@@ f@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company G@@ f@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him remain .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group G@@ f@@ K : after re@@ dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ c@@ is@@ sion of corporate management , the global number five in the industry faces a new beginning .
G@@ RP Chief Executive Officer plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board of G@@ f@@ K Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already dischar@@ ges from the supervisory body with effect from September 12 .
the management board of the Management Board will take up the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger as of September 1 , announced the company .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; Chief Executive Officer , &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a spokesperson on Friday .
those who will continue to lead the market research company in future are still unclear .
in investor circles it was called on Friday , in which shareholders were most recently disappointed with the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the G@@ f@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad G@@ f@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become un@@ settled .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the Company did not have the ability to stop its loss car@@ ry@@ forwards in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparative quarter of the previous year .
compared to the first half of the year , sales increased by 3.4 percent to 72@@ 1.2 million euros .
in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were largely de@@ bit@@ ed .
the company &apos;s impair@@ ments of 139 million euros , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , weigh@@ ed a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the balance sheet .
the G@@ f@@ K achieved consolidated net income of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 .
accidents - Bus stops in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
eight people have been injured in the accident of a bus with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , notified the police .
according to her data , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , Germany , had to avoid her information to a vice , which took part in the return journey .
the bus stopped right off the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch as a spokes@@ woman of the Police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travel@@ er were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement coach of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck drivers and potential witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to € 3.@@ 44 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl sewage system ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ort 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover is being carried out for these sewage installations .
due to legal basis , the Casino market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ effective basis .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board , a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period between October 2016 and September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be equ@@ ated .
according to Schmidt , the serious increase in fee rose by the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low volume of wastewater , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing .
furthermore , due to their age remedi@@ ation and repair expenditure , not least due to their age , renovation and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent during the subsequent calculation period .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the sewage plant in Az@@ endorf .
the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground in the Wel@@ sch@@ ahl pumping station and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation system could be installed to meet the requirements of the water law in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully hit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Schmidt , the market community of major maintenance costs in the waste water systems , has been spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
according to Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal sewage @-@ purpose association could not be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent institutions .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , as positive 0.2 % posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared with July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed compared with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian cartoon is critici@@ zed
snap@@ shots tell that this filter is Ani@@ me @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , it allows for Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absurd .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are bl@@ unt , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carriage returns to the public .
in the past , the Snap@@ chat Fil@@ ters have critic@@ ised themselves for being accused of promoting black@@ face promotions or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal .
when it proposed a filter to some users this week , who gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics named a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; ja@@ un@@ dice . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled this feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism rec@@ alled the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and said to be uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very disgu@@ sting Asian cartoon and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yel@@ low@@ ish face was drawn into the opposite extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counterpart - could rather expect to expect sensitivity .
when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it used to be the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for media , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and others to do the same .
in a record for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes that ra@@ cial controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what to do against it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Snap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
for her part , Z@@ hu said that she will have her Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , establishes Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed an investigation committee of the congress to report in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Army Committee , Secret Service Committ@@ ees and the Ar@@ med Forces Com@@ mit@@ ment , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts , who reported how superi@@ ors their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed .
the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ like information , typically printed on by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly drew a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism as they would have allowed the actual states on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; what happened at the Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; K@@ en Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , stated .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions under Obama &apos;s instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement .
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will be continued .
in addition , further investigation of the Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the Secretary @-@ General of the Department of Defense .
the Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; said the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ cra@@ t in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damaged morality among analysts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ Com analysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
last August , the New York Times reported from an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , which was taken up by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress , while the general inspec@@ tors were still in full swing .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations also have a re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the Islamic State &apos;s sal@@ aries of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , only fores@@ aw a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker , according to government officials stated , that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ n commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the United States is winning fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain is before
a day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember ever doing that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know this : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , who after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter final , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed the strong D@@ ut@@ ch@@ man a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
whatever the game on Saturday , the American women triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time she had a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands ( her two older sisters play sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to plu@@ ck the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door row in the first half of the game with a back cover from the near area .
India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and drew the ball into the gate to give the female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , as late as it is , there are the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Jan@@ eiro feel permanent and inevitable , a fast relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
you can &apos;t turn on the television , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic gymn@@ as@@ tics .
the Olympic flame does not match any event alike .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I have a modest attitude for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although jumping on the trampoline was an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ sely noticed for the last 16 years that many of those I had inter@@ viewed did not know that it was an olymp@@ ic sport at all .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had won an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
the trampoline jumping has a certain type of out@@ sider , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an experienced enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means much like &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
asp@@ iring Win@@ ner jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympics program , they are evaluated according to the execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio against each other .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold need to go further , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and down , up and down on the playground .
they ch@@ ase not only the finish line or the output wall , but also an additional high goal in the TV transmission : the world or the olymp@@ ic record .
the goal @-@ oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed even when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing spell .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly up again .
there is also competition here , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it &apos;s as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 1.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday also at 1.@@ 00 p.m .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the object qualification of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects a new fan community to breathe .
&quot; one generation prot@@ esting &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police during shooting .
is Ethiopia just breaking together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less according to human rights organizations .
witnesses stated that police fired and killed on ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos being circul@@ ated about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the Horn of Africa Project Manager of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terror threats over the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or pushed into the des@@ erts of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ze@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold over power of the governing coalition .
following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ ga@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which in recent years were en@@ forced more or less , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of t@@ ink@@ age under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services have improved .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they gathered so much to protest .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s mainly Christian high @-@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economics , while they exploited the Oro@@ sei , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is also changing .
&quot; we are here to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ m .
the largest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ per@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi &apos;s death .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 .
he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
contrary to Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 , after thousands protest against elections which , according to analysts , apparently were mess@@ ed up by the government and then stolen .
during the following ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in comb@@ ating poverty .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal mis@@ conception of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ pers@@ ist city , attacked businesses from Tig@@ ray and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even if it announced recently that it has closed this base .
while the West definitely wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le territory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has been founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication gave rise to new questions about the communication capabilities of Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
it also brings forth his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants , who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump left behind the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews he meant the accus@@ ation entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential Candi@@ date wanted to know nothing about it .
the last storm of criticism lev@@ elled down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on account of falling survey values on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later said &quot; Of course I thought it was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive , and then , if necessary , clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements very vag@@ ue , so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways .
instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump adopted an even more corro@@ sive sound , as its survey values declined further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general tries to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor .
but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princip@@ als , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely false and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq .
most of the mainstream re@@ public@@ ans argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by aggres@@ sively taking control of the situation in the Middle East .
before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and taking action against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twi@@ light &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the president &apos;s office .
once disp@@ l@@ aces the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sk@@ inn@@ y cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices were pushed out of Bed@@ ford Avenue store front .
the soap Cher@@ ie store , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a rival town .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is change , then it is also rein@@ vention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafe .
he started working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outside office , he was excited to do so , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
verb works the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment too .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ c@@ ers .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also driven by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s awards , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebec@@ ca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and regularly visited the club .
even after being pulled to Green@@ point , she would take the way .
after the verb has closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that there was coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of the usual iced coffee that is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth to seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment over the fact that the soap business had taken the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go down to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice bar would like to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
for many customers a new verb is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt had a fi@@ ai@@ ble for sophisticated delic@@ at@@ essen on Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was slightly more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; was a Chinese cuisine in the USA , while in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; it was told about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive branches , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered min@@ ced ro@@ ast , this found the couple fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; explains Ziegel@@ man .
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and p@@ opp@@ y bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E was gr@@ inning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You Can E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; stands out for the ways that the country turned around to be no longer the land of Cock@@ aig@@ ne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se topic for the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told him why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ d@@ ants became the stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; as coo@@ ks could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for many years , became a rare luxury .
strange mixtures were tested , as a calorie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious gr@@ ati@@ fication took preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick is a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter , too .
&quot; it was not a popular additive at lun@@ ch@@ time , &quot; says Co@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping recipes .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - ab@@ rup@@ tly attacked the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household members &quot; and the challenge of transforming pamp@@ h@@ lets like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical delicacies .
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , like President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s l@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake food attitude .
while he openly appl@@ au@@ ded the simple I@@ owa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million @-@ million@@ aire man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country returned to the legs .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , declared bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bricks remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the vor@@ tex of the wind .
after the plates were cleared near Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um recipe that President Ro@@ os@@ ev@@ elt ate at mid@@ day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
each di@@ ved somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E scored three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack of the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil defence group , which according to Bild @-@ Zeitung had saved almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers are putting their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the Civil Defence , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrian the shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said lou@@ dly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he spoke in a video about the last bom@@ bing ra@@ ids in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have dropped four fac@@ et bombs over the Alz@@ hei@@ a district , one filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children can play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quote his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s hair usually comes to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the north Atlantic Ocean , an average of 1,@@ 220 meters in an hour .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.@@ 6m / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed .
however , this lifestyle shaped by slow@@ ness seems to be a recipe for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; explains Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist assumed long that Greenland sh@@ arks are stone @-@ old .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland sh@@ arks are hard to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually only appear in the winter at the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
their slow @-@ bends measured them , when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver , which tor@@ kel from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
to determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks were remark@@ ably carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons sh@@ one large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all the larger Greenland sh@@ arks in their lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers could assign the length to an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks obviously allow at least one and a half centuries time with the reproduction .
this should also be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year old Greenland , whose bac@@ on stuck on the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals also often runs on infl@@ amed ceilings .
they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often particularly large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the Evol@@ ution@@ ary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted Mayor Robert P@@ utz &apos;s announcement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and development questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications on surve@@ ying have been clari@@ fied , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; Street @-@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction section 1 ) is no longer available to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au attract young families and former sen@@ iors alike .
as it was said , building wil@@ lows can immediately register in the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to be able to respond to requests for sett@@ ling other businesses , combined with job creation , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ time@@ frame area , the industrial area already shown there will be extended by two par@@ c@@ els towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , admission to Britain is sufficient for them until now .
this is the advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced that they will shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervision E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk capital ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its head office , but this is less significant to the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg considers a large fund sector , it also deterior@@ ates badly in infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach .
furthermore , the city points to easy @-@ to @-@ use commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder says .
in addition , the rent for premium commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality .
in a ranking of the corporate consultancy Merc@@ er , the city is ranked 7th , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin in No@@ .@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors , &quot; said the I@@ W .
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , my economic researchers .
the balance of forces also speaks for this : in London according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ sement of the legal costs that have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was liber@@ ated from a damages payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were linked to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead after a US judge revealed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ice and other un@@ ethical acts .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of costs that have ar@@ isen during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to match Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed property on laboratory work , including Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
U.S. supported troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control of Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
the US @-@ backed forces have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j close to the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are cur@@ bing the city following the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried within the city .
they released over 2,000 civilians , held as ho@@ stages by the fighters , and shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , which was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are currently carrying out clearing work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton released its tax declaration on Friday , which resulted in the democr@@ ats &apos; presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton recorded $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ em@@ or@@ ariums ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their term of office in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declarations of the last ten years .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; admitted Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement .
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false phrases and re@@ treats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ ton &apos;s electoral hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the release of the democr@@ ats candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not completed .
dr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal raises questions relating to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business people and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday , in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls for his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump paid no or only very little taxes for two years , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors on Friday that it might still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , invited Tr@@ ump to a meeting to discuss their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax test and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns as far back as 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that they only purchased USD 100 of their income as wage , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clin@@ tons were tax@@ ed and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ds , fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
nature conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into inhabited settlements - they t@@ oss con@@ doms on them that are filled with chill@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea ahead of years , intensified its promotion along with the U.S. nature protection , trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is World War Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit we were able to observe within these communities a change in their attitude , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the manager of Hon@@ ey@@ ance Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body in a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on chim@@ ney swe@@ eps into the air .
a touch is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last chance is a wor@@ shi@@ pper which shoots a gold mine fire@@ works into the air , causing a loud , light explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no new ki@@ osk @-@ building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the city council is now unanim@@ ously rejected by the application for the new construction of a sale ski@@ os@@ ks located on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine river .
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in exposed locations on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction .
Jewish director sm@@ ashed Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; demand - RT news
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uprising , after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ election since there were Arab guests &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last visit , Lanz@@ mann attempted to find Israel at the country selection list of the hotel .
the country , however , was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center .
following an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sho@@ ck@@ led him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ aid the alleged &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ sten@@ dam@@ m , close to a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct statement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to add Israel to the electoral list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it adds that the country code has now been added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
police put tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in Sao Paulo , Brazil , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of the state Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ mine , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the participants of the protest were gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests erup@@ ted a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been reli@@ eved of office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading volume between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent .
since the international sanctions have been lifted up against Iran , the interest in Russian companies on businesses in the country increased strongly , the ambassador informed them .
Russian companies are adop@@ ting existing links with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trade boom was achieved through deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan is anticip@@ ating a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign agency represented around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran has reached the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
looking for witnesses : drinks market in forest fires inv@@ ade
a rob@@ ber@@ y fell on Thursday evening on the drinks market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the au@@ spices of a gun , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink bar and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money was stolen .
the perpet@@ rators were to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small .
the drinks market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market and is badly observ@@ able .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators will have to travel to Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be driven by the gravel car park located opposite the car park entrance with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in direction B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Ped@@ ago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ egi@@ vers on their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the seclu@@ ded recreation area hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ idle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
to the other , to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s tour in the world famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ Museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
for the culinary occasion children and car@@ egi@@ vers were spoiled with their own cooked food such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops it was made to create beautiful jewels of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman @-@ Mill game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the ministers from the counsel@@ ing unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Church of the Order of Ministers , St. Anna , decided to prepare and carry out a long @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided in favour of the bish@@ op@@ ric town of Fri@@ bourg , where , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opening of mercy of the Freiburg Min@@ ster .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and the se@@ pul@@ ch@@ re , and the hal@@ fl@@ ing rooms , went their way .
in the evening before the parish priest saved the pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
from Hor@@ b he was driven by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster began .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at field @-@ crossing , chap@@ els or churches always again and again to sing a song from specially compiled pilgri@@ m @-@ song .
for the overnight stays the parish offices of the local parish priests were available .
at the destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were ass@@ uring for a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and the breakfast .
we continued on the second day via Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the day after that , one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but had to climb some 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again .
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing lake in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly ligh@@ tened and happy the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and crossed the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse , God thank@@ ed God .
the Min@@ is by co@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service , the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hes home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ined last night in the men team spr@@ int at Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , which his fellow coun@@ try@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y made himself to E@@ igen . the boy proudly made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y scored the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after winning in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in good time as a Hin@@ du .
his retirement generated a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton attempted to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner played an Olympic @-@ ord in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap was tight , Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow him down and enable him to keep pace with Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic @-@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the train .
he later re@@ fut@@ ed this statement and there was no obj@@ ection of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
this time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we have been so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it &apos;s in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would mean Kenn@@ y , who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y will take part in the spr@@ int that will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should become a k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where the focus will be on W@@ ig@@ gins .
he had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the same women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a bunch of med@@ als .
after a truly remarkable representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
Dra@@ mas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex and mo@@ b@@ bing alleg@@ ations as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment reached its climax , will be repeated .
the future of the melting of Port@@ land is dou@@ bt@@ ful due to the lifting of the energy yield
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus lifts all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company has announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 year prevention subsi@@ dy exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 workplaces in the Al@@ coa facility in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 work@@ stations -@@ direct and indirect - could be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed in a closure .
in addition , it could come to Dom@@ ino effects as the melting process consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , who supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , stated that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller portions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 fiscal year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L recei@@ pts from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong prices for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in his annual subscription of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired .
the US company said that 2010 signed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation of why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt shop in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses about 900 meg@@ a@@ watts each year to consume some 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator this would not be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a mere carto@@ on@@ ist reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ the@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the U.S. Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran to Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the revelation of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , bel@@ ted reality video showing the entire Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ an J@@ en@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the universally popular show bi@@ z unc@@ le and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as they have all planned a surprise party .
this is the c@@ lich@@ é gesture of almost every birthday child of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ re brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls take part in this publi@@ city .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the existence of Kar@@ d@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim may have beaten her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold out edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a volume similar to a picture book rather like a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ist@@ a were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the walt@@ z 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awa@@ ited that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine were still se@@ eping before the official announcement .
Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s include women who were already on the cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of its generation - falls below the previous category , it is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the fashion world was always something ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called her &quot; Mist@@ resses of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding around on the m@@ all seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
she is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ée Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the LOVE magazine .
and in her leisure time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal centres annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary exi@@ gen@@ cies are annually rejected by the municipal centres , while the industry is looking forward to the impact of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violent acts and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are prepared for further reductions .
as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding .
the director of the Municipal Council of Com@@ mit@@ ment Centr@@ es of Que@@ bec , James Far@@ rel@@ l , said that the last survey conducted by the National Uni@@ fication of Public Service Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only become worse without the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal centres are under@@ financed chron@@ ically , meaning that thousands of people are exp@@ elled from important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been sack@@ ed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance .
we urge the At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to delay these medi@@ ations immediately , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems .
last year , the state government agreed to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their customers and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after staff allegedly drew arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after she has been told that in February her campaign leader for North Carolina directed a gun to an employee while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ish@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; it would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the campaign manager , Earl Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel in Vinc@@ ents kne@@ ec@@ eh@@ le , &quot; stated B@@ ish@@ i in his indictment .
after compl@@ aining about local and regional campaign management , B@@ ish@@ i realized that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosecution comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm owners and tru@@ sts - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton was to be elected and judge judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign clearly indicated that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ish@@ is complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due diligence and Philip due to physical injury and lack of psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was unable to reach a position .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer in the campaign .
responding to phone calls at his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of federal elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) there are considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CD@@ U .
this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute In@@ sa for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ c@@ ely go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD crashed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to a survey , the party is still smiling shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is conten@@ tious between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( 18.@@ 4 per cent before ) ; the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluc@@ tant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
in each case , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the parliament with 3 percent .
according to the survey , the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties showed only 23 percent ( 2011 election : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U achieved only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still lies behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
with 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives for the first time .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the pir@@ ates would not miss in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia Communic@@ ator was on the market .
the successor domin@@ ates the world today - its maker experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ able .
the built @-@ in memory was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes at the beginning , which would suff@@ ice for approximately two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigab@@ ytes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came to business exactly 20 years ago , and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but somehow they come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west pocket format . &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be reached .
even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ Browser , even though agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the era of smartphones .
everything has changed since then .
the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually sold and handled to Microsoft .
the market today domin@@ ates suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
approximately 1.4 billion units were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
global sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all with touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ ant success began , the iPhone is still the most important product of the Group today .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the chance to see .
she eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now has Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
on average , every German now sees 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone even away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive committee . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must guide the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we took a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone , we will alone have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too large .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will bla@@ ze ourselves on the world stage .
the doubts were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row as well .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers each question presented to him .
like the Olympic Games He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in am@@ using growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team at He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T2 , built in the midst of the world &apos;s two most popular cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk supported by £ 16 billion in private investments .
the 2012 London Olympics were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time that we direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding for its adver@@ ts in order to make it difficult to detect advertisements about which part of the site is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to circum@@ vent the new codes .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ f@@ ro battle between the open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sign@@ makers have become for the industry .
according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide use display lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion active users who access their mobile devices on Facebook , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of adverti@@ sed Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue .
the company has been target@@ ing ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , announced a narr@@ ator .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a big share of revenues , so Facebook will see the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; ad preference tool &quot; to give people more control over their advertising .
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying new filters because they would block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead of putting more control into the hands of people .
exagger@@ ating woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway .
the police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was over@@ driven by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
a woman was in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that at the age of 49 , a Swiss woman who has been convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she still died on the spot .
several drivers have already heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police told them that they , as well as every witness of the incident , ur@@ ges him to report .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes dedicated Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the public prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after having crossed and killed a man who was located on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street , took the court .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who had replied to an emergency call -- ran into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
according to projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus probably once inhab@@ itable .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded subli@@ me conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and still turned slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic variation to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun , which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus will expose its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; said G@@ ISS Scienti@@ st Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought about a history of Venus , which resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers .
although it was supposedly hab@@ itable , Venus -- over several billion years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans have evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen with@@ drew , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with@@ drew with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy performs as trainer of A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy stepped back on Thursday as coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to minor co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
Altern@@ ativ @-@ President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly tailored to the organisation &apos;s needs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are not currently being met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was honored during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league .
he led the club to 112 points and ranked first in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the last season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches featured a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference at five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike strike
the labour struggles on remuneration for North Sea workers are suspended , while all the conten@@ ders for a new round of talks are sitting at the table , the negoti@@ ators said .
strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were carried out spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group and the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold a couple of full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems .
the trade unions told that their last strike , which was the first in more than 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has cut rates to its tractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said additional cuts to the company gives the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to ren@@ ounce its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as it ration@@ alizes its business activities as a result of its Meg@@ a@@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure due to the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that had increased by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected in 2016 for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster .
the new data help the astronom@@ er to understand why stars revol@@ ve around different rates in the star cluster as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planet origin .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other Stern@@ enh@@ aufen we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Re@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated some 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest .
at peak @-@ rate @-@ rates , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars encounter large amounts of star @-@ winds .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star al@@ erts , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the cluster of stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , when and why stars would slow down their rates of rotation and , so to speak , hang their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades rot@@ ational rates , which will soon appear in the astronom@@ ical journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star takes off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days from Base to Base .
following his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say good@@ bye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , and in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been granting him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will become a consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall of F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old cannot be admitted to the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls .
for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star has admitted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have banned &quot; ster@@ oids &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , it was blocked for 211 players by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is regarded as the main suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida for many years .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor to me for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez back at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even his f@@ arewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends have played the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the relationship with pop star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of the Y@@ ank@@ ee arch@@ rival , Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want a @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
blur@@ red : because of a positive test of dop@@ ing , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Jan@@ eiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events are known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Jan@@ eiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already cri@@ tically poll@@ uted athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the unknown .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected in Ch@@ en last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Criminal Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old finished fourth in the final about 100 m butterfly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the hand@@ rails over 50 m of Fre@@ est@@ yle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the national association is taking the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demanding full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Criminal Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , IO@@ C is no longer responsible , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tioning of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news spread over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tic expert . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , the forbidden substance is supposed to act as an EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should have already had a positive effect .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Boy@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported on the issue of criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , any weight lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case was also known as &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before .
both deny the intake , but both may not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the ath@@ lete , especially the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in the course of the swimming sport , the former off@@ ences in China had also caused violent clas@@ hes among the athletes .
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t har@@ sh@@ ly attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ est@@ yle I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to take a three @-@ month lock .
data theft : h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by malware @-@ defense specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies have been at least once , in part multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software in the past twelve months .
in Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize in attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be black@@ ened is considerably higher than for private users .
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot;
in 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mail software for itself .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months start@@ ling swiftly .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als permanently .
the software then presents the recei@@ v@@ ables of the black@@ mail .
to get the end @-@ turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of Cryp@@ to@@ Mor@@ ning Bit@@ coin .
but where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ dingly higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 percent of German companies affected reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely interrup@@ ting business activity , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks , whose patients may be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ rators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail users and come to the conclusion that the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or deci@@ ph@@ er sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively high @-@ risk gains from the Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers are becoming more professional and share the work , security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski stated by the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four people .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual test@@ ers .
the so @-@ called malware @-@ kits were created using malware , advice , and additional tools for a single , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
so you log into one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts you to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals engage in sp@@ amm@@ ing with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Survey are confident to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery , perpet@@ rators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes CEO Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz , Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a block@@ aded heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the interior materials are well processed and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles with storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l for inver@@ ted back@@ rests , but the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seating surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin chairs and therefore offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceilings .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , however , the loading height is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1,6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he is likely to do a bit qui@@ eter in his work .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is still another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering should be a little more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the top version tested &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City @-@ emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning is sometimes irrit@@ ated because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the remote @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent tem@@ por@@ ter re@@ acts to the recognition of traffic signs and throt@@ tles the speed as required .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack sits below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from € 200@@ 00 , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not responsible : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only possible in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical for air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
however , the accident could have been happening everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
illness Case : when the Organ@@ izer pays
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back if the cause of the disease is doub@@ tless to be found in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the negotiated case , a family had suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a faulty treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip was defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
before the Court , the plain@@ ti@@ ffs did not succeed .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learnt about it shortly before the arrival of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that sea@@ water was al@@ right .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since in the samples of water no im@@ puri@@ ties were found .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion with each other - belonged to the general li@@ fest@@ y@@ les .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people would have concerns about further attacks .
the state must be so@@ ber and resol@@ ute to react at the same time to terrorist threats .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country will not answer the violence perpet@@ rated by the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this triumph we will not treat the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders will have to leave the country faster , it will increase the security and strengthen the agreement of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère intends to achieve a implementation of proposals to the 2017 federal election .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over several years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must be re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated .
video surveillance should be improved , so that it can be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the most recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the danger of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning to use concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel told us : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly expressed himself against action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was a sla@@ p for the exec@@ ution@@ ers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union for a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it constitutes a general prohibition of full wear for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you are rej@@ ecting , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
one could talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the Minister of simul@@ ating vig@@ or and capacity for action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more safety in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but that should change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers , who stand in traffic on the ambient street every evening when they drive via the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction company will be extended by 700 metres on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 to 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Straße exit .
drivers can then turn right onto the right from the Hammer street .
the big advantage : the traffic is split up early , thus improving the overall workflow on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West .
the train con@@ stric@@ tion on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the traffic jam up to the bridge over the Alber@@ go way and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , the traffic is only ste@@ ered in one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations have shown that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to absorb heavy @-@ duty traffic .
the competent regional company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated week@@ day con@@ ges@@ tion will continue .
however , years have to be reck@@ oned with : because the bridge has an official remaining period of rest until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the State Agency has deliberately chosen the less traffic time during the school holidays due to the fact that people with disabilities expect to be reck@@ oned with .
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday by one lane at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a musical project .
N@@ ima &apos;s society allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ visible Haus &quot; of the Young Theater in Münster .
in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s society , 19 students between 11 and 15 years of age visited the st@@ aging at the Little House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the young@@ sters of the class have come to Münster from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , so the press release of the boy The@@ aters Münster .
N@@ ima &apos;s society , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg , is born out of spray , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical communication skills are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for better weather
the weather has made a das@@ h through the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star@@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour are one of the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one wal@@ lows etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
it &apos;s anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
there are several forms of sleep disturbances , and there can be many causes behind them , emphasizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German society for sleep and sleep medicine .
what you understand for the time being , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , a sleeping disorder .
through sleep many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , a member of the Executive Board at the German Dental Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind them can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medications .
not in@@ frequently is sleep disorder an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is particularly frequent in the case of depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
for example , those who have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can be bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to p@@ onder@@ ate about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems become a doctor ?
if you are not sleeping well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day , you should go to the doctor , don &apos;t throw away any fire .
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments such as stomach or head@@ aches .
in order to relieve sleeping disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there are few low @-@ seated dormit@@ ories in Germany , emphas@@ ised Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Center for S@@ leep Medicine at the Char@@ ité University Hospital in Berlin .
this is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems .
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep and what will happen ?
for example , for the examination in the sleeping laboratory , doctors advise against snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ements , for path@@ ological day fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder , Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; please do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze .
after the cal@@ ming you go to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger .
in addition , a camera monitors the sleeping area on the ceiling .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
a blast counts : regular sleeping and standing up times , do not sleep long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television to sleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve to it .
what the jungle camp has to offer with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he took gold for the first time at the Doh@@ a Short @-@ Track World Championships and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler faces his prot@@ rac@@ ted ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle King 15@@ 0,000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page at night .
the transport system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , however , the dop@@ ing controls are very good .
with this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not exactly look at dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be registered already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS can &apos;t be controlled by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says Hamburg &apos;s election Hamburger , who meanwhile operates an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : gang of baggage
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the police of Düsseldorf &apos;s police managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the susp@@ ects used several bags and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil servants at the airport of Düsseldorf recognised a gang , which was known to polic@@ emen from past theft sc@@ ams .
since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and have been treated in a common , labour @-@ friendly manner and especially professionally .
the specialists of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four acts to the thi@@ eves who had entered Germany specifically for comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences .
in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a couple of lime trees , in between yet another cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem like this , but the police count them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
opposite a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demoli@@ shed , will be built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
in recent weeks articles about this &quot; trendy district , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , are being preferred with burning cars .
reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , particularly Berlin &apos;s inner sen@@ ator Henkel had expressed himself for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , were cleared with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks , according to official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers were renov@@ ating the rooms on behalf of the unknown land@@ lords .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain themselves in front of Sp@@ ä@@ ti .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who has three children here , are especially gener@@ ously affected by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a neighborhood that mostly caused police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police distinguish between the land@@ owners and their neighbors , does not seem to exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers &quot; district , which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city .
in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including almost all of the Main@@ zer Street close to the Riga City .
while the Main@@ zer was swe@@ pt under a large police command in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er have been leg@@ alized and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ers from all over the world : now residents from G@@ DR times and former home owners share their Kie@@ z .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them on inserted discs or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with colour @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Left @-@ Autonom@@ ous Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : crimes such as personal injury are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the crimes are caused by material damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as far as violence is concerned , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined for that .
even the famous burning cars no longer give it in the Rig@@ a@@ er any longer .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer moved consciously into the Riga @-@ Straße - and stayed .
that is why it was so important for her that local residents get their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly stra@@ ined the interpretation sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to be taken away : with fac@@ eless new buildings in former building @-@ holes , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well searched here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what can you do if someone never li@@ stens to it ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for the drawn ones who are fre@@ eing themselves about colour bom@@ b@@ ings : the Hau@@ schild family projects and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area , which can badly complain about noise there .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is new Refu@@ ge@@ e Repres@@ entative
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le has been the Om@@ bud@@ s@@ man for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working groups refugees , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ice @-@ loving wo@@ ollen @-@ sow , which has a problem above all .
thus some - less mo@@ ck@@ ering but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job .
we were looking for an executive power with a talent for languages and people connected with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a self @-@ reli@@ ant lust for wool .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent point limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
new containers will soon be available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights , which have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you have to put the refugees in your own or hired living rooms .
the Municip@@ alities themselves must bear the costs of the construction , rent or the renovation of these accommodations .
the responsibility changes from the Office of Agriculture to the Commun@@ e and Job@@ centers .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord is willing to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it doesn &apos;t work so far , you depend on private apartments , so D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; said Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house master , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very or@@ derly , as Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here , administration and volunteers are also involved here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they need to explain to refugees that it will take time to bridge the time , for example with language courses .
anyone who develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach will not be able to work and be useless , and he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are problems , too , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people in whom nothing works . &quot; the work of D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community such as Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customers clearly say &quot; what some nai@@ ve call &quot; might be . a residual risk could and would not exclude them .
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also a matter of refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would make them complete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the local and local volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly , politics are afraid .
it is actually unfair to place them on site .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka D@@ eu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ an@@ ium has already been utilized to integrate the existing people wis@@ ely .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
