<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sportpyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses reminded themselves of their celebrations, they hunted at the fast gallop back home to the feedstuff.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at that pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And that was the end of the riding career.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament wins - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He had his family run over the ALRV, on a horse he did not even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and therewith also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid presented the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala, the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no shortage of accolades to the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Federal Cross of Merit, Silver bay leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already begged him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "" "" "says Langer," "" "" "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been promoting junior staff.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away.</seg>
<seg id="23">With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="24">The performers include the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the true Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Roger-driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports leagues came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Laureate Prize was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - we want Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are undivided in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">About the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against how the state of the economy can do harm - with taxes and regulations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "he will go down substantially, and he's strong for a far-reaching fiscal reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfill, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would increase for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the US, Trump and Clinton say almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly opposed by the state-critical teapparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump there could still be party-internal discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more significant.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in protected areas, and he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection treaty.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend the renewable energy with its investment programme and demands: "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazilian trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "at the same time both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but rather protect American jobs better." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">They are to be paid better, e.g. Clinton says.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rend, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop rather to the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "on the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics contend him, so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand Clinton, who wants to demand at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every woman who fled has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fleeing alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women sit in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby at most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled briefly and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">She is the Business Manager of Condrobs, a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the topic of women on the run.</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the North of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single-wing women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs worked together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">There are 60 people living there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is not exaggerated to say," "" "" "" "every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her flight," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as a ray of hope to Europe," she says.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "among women there are other reasons for the escape:" "" "" "" "many steal away secretly because they see no other way out." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">In their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honors, slavery or forced prostitution.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run, this goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the fact that the tugs demand a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," "" "" "" "says Bahr." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">Anyone who believes that the end as soon as they come to Germany irre tells us.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst misused.</seg>
<seg id="32">This leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the shelter in the north of Munich are traumatized, she appreciates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children did not come up voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "or they dare not speak openly about what has been experienced, because the shame is too great." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">Because they often don't know how to help, they need more accommodations only for them, Bahr says.</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some say no to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in lodging of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia, even winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are floors or own houses in some community shelters only for single women and their children.</seg>
<seg id="42">The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" "" "" "" "Committee also calls for women to be sheltered from men." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="46">Above all, the washrooms should be separated and accessible to women easily, in the study.</seg>
<seg id="47">How much women feel this need for protection can be read at the urge to go to the house in Munich.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves hands and proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was rude and he barely radiated heat, even for his reticent circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "however, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke about his" "" "" "" "dear friend" "" "" "" "Putin -" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper complained that Erdogan had behaved as though something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was rampant.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin instigated and accused Ankara to fall into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To re-establish nests becomes difficult if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The serious accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's territories, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan desperately needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved last month at a failed coup d "état of almost his office.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">Tour operators and charter companies in Russia will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports were once again allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">A report in Vedemosti put it in the following words: "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it regards the response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the continued resentment on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is pierced to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara with security a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow that has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glorious palace on the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders," as an analyst once described: two countries that are torn off from the West and feel badly treated and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents stated at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and considering the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey ousted the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least again.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of Putin's cramped trust in many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is said that without giving reasons, Putin ordered" "" "" "" "the dismissal of Ivanovo from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy since 2012, was appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in Tokyo's embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it means (in Russian) that he was later the logistical officer and manager of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think it is the main task of the government to support your work as head of state with regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the narrowest confidant Vladimir Putin's and works as he stands for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff recedes on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smiles for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So is the consequence of a kind of struggle for power?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president who would once again lead Russian environmental policy - met with great skepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "It is true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation to give me this very complicated post - one could almost say - placing an equivalent post for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin reached power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another close ally close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensland crossings to the Viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is the first of four closures of the "ceiling blowers" approaching completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incline ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Economic minister Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said," "" "" "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic scale in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel, which were used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">A total of almost 79% of the deck's deck is located at its place and the last section of the deck is given today in Rosyth a concrete nut for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "the first shutter represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking portrait and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the gap already existing on the north or the north side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern spreading bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive yet very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, which pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teens and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time watching TV screens, has been accused of many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially on TV, then limited to video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.</seg>
<seg id="7">I'm obviously referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a series of animations, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">How many pop culture phenomena sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons that are tracked with a GPS and once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the boat and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the United States, the game has led to a considerable increase in steps that the average person restores each day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardihat, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days after market launch, the number of tracked people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks at the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">Many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes" to "get away from the sofa" and "being active every day" hit the deaf ears because many public messages about health are boring and come from people looking miserable.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone exercising sports regularly reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it helps people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also spoiler bumpers, who always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games that combine apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Biles is immune to all that.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breath taking place on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on a whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked off on Thursday for a multi-battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" -team-kameradin Aly Raisman and the Russian Bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women Simone Biles culminates on the balance beam during the single multi-campaign of women in the gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and the fifth as she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey had ended at that very moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the past three years, 15 World Championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Retton said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited them a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between it and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-campaign women of the women at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday as she served as exclamation mark at the farewell ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during their long march, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of her soil exercises - which contain her typical Tumbling Pass - is adapted to Latin American music, which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a little child and discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion to the gymnasium where Boorman trained, became the force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition in the competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafa was easily led by two rotations, the picture deceiled.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish lumber and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world champion title - lured.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still sat on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her final funeral - a pure formality - and tears poured out on Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafa.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team capitulated who is called "grandma" by the Americans.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her turmoil she threw the crowd into the crowd, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Biles is concerned, the rapidly spreading weet of the 19-year-old has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting the investigators led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>

<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="2">Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call the state of emergency on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi River flooded their shores and threatened with widespread flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the affected congregations.</seg>

<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a stream-downstream flooding in Ascension Parish represents a danger since they will only flow slowly over the trodden rivers into Lake Maurepas.</seg>

<seg id="14">Bailout teams still attacked people from flood waters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved by gloom on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house, rose greatly over night.</seg>

<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the handicaps and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that emergency pers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were lodged until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">Krautmann said the flood was spreading rapidly, as there were still heavy rainfalls and the authorities considered evacuation directions.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer came near Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil was considerably sucked by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and floods caused the rescuing of inhabitants from their houses in Tangipahoa Parish and the excursion in five school districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine in the gymnastics club in the gymnastics club and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three Turneresses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls from other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Cocian, the Catholic, rounds off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally mirroring the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female female Turner was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startled Olympic champion and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez offering unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual female American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but we don't see sports classes anywhere in the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all hit the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily invest in private gyms, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in wealthy suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the gymnasts get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give inspiration to the churches aun countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I have founded my Foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events, we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international champions.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health and schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this true depiction of "Girl Power" by the wood of the Olympic team gold and thanks, you get motivated as many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians voted in favour of a vote rejected it.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt's plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty, saying that the NHS was found in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first physicians should receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend stays in order to improve the care at times of irregular time.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistance physicians announced last night in a communication with: "assistance physicians have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current crisis of the workforce and to treat it to meet all the doctors."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks that remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through dialogue met with the government on reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was done by a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise the condition and address the cares of the assistance physicians."</seg>

<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better week remuneration for the 54,000 common physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employee, called on the doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">Mortimer said: "work-fighting measures do not reach a minimum, but already burden unloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient, caregivers and their families only worry, need and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">In the last two months, we talked to the committee of assistance doctors and had a positive response to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement with other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional timeframe, training days, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training vacations and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education United Kingdom and the Ministry of Health were in compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2-per day drug after being advised by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The NICE regulatory authority has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the artery walls that form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause blood clots that clog the blood flow to the heart and thereby cause a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots are released, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The NICE line draft, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">The experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Last year the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office because of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread voting fraud in Muslim municipalities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and city councils to have ignored the evidence of election abuses due to "hypersensitivity in regard to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former minister of integration and municipal government, which is now an anti-corruption emperor, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motifs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside election cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should lead an identification card to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At the moment a voter only has to name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes not to apply removable ink to a person's finger when they release their vote to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">It demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader base of corruption and financial fraud," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election skandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special judgment ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman was to be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his office after a litany.</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical manner" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the ground that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him. "</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation where one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric stated that there was evidence in the whole country for fraud.</seg>
<seg id="18">He expressed in particular alarming to the fraudulent letter of letters - the elder members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including performing ID cards to prove the identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it says: "evidence has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exerted, especially women and young people, in order to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "there have been concerns... government institutions have knowingly ignored such behaviour because of" politically correct "sensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric gave 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the ban on political activists to process letter selection to stop "election harvest."</seg>
<seg id="23">The report considered by Theresa May also requires tougher registration verification to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and social security purposes.</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on a person's finger once it has released its voice to prevent someone to choose twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to ensure they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for automatic postal voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activists deal full post-elections and envelopes of local elections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers for election stations.</seg>

<seg id="32">Requirement that only English should be used in the election stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees generally enforce that voters walk alone in the election cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at the distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer against your predator.</seg>
<seg id="5">If you look at you from behind you should turn yourself first, so that you can see your attacker and "go out of the shot," says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Hit it then with your knee in the lath and twist while the attacker curbs against pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the barrel in the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="8">With attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot, grab the weapon and twist them so that the aggressor cannot shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, shift weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon on it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Does it sound difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how it performs Mizrachi.</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious test of his immune system and thrower, taking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk turned his train on a Euro note, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before checking every object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of decking the rinsing button of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by travelling through the world and eating peculiar and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public handrails to stations to rinsing toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, soil, worms and mud."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample painting showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to check after its luminometer number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60 units.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "in the film he says:" "" "" "" "that comes close to what I have cleaned in a toilet." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutinous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick here anything because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">Valio Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "we really wanted to offer consumers something new.</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "we conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying" "" "" "" "Give us Ian." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to set them up and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all polled lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least occasionally they use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed plaintive holes, wooden planks were torn open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared onto the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private accomodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she fears that the apartment is no longer to be repaired.</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons living in the apartment and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted on street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, strikers and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>

<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing hired her and her partner violently from the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to withdraw.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family had agreed to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years long</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the village house.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "he added:" "" "" "" "it is a shame that the lessee would agree to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delodation is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">"West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli</seg>
<seg id="2">In Shakespeare's year, the Salzburg Festival explores the West Side Story with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple like Romeo and Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="3">With it a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leverkard Bernstein's masterpiece.</seg>
<seg id="5">The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.</seg>
<seg id="6">The orchestra pit the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan Conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "this music is full of rhythm," he warms.</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and their melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we have amber music really in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">In this staging Bartoli plays an older Maria.</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers with nostalgia her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">First, because it is musically exceptional!</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">She says in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">So it's wise, of course also naïve, and very passionate.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as Roman," Bartoli laughs.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer:" "" "" "" "Cecilia is a wonderful artist." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honor to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">She is an enormously large person.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "and Bartoli returns the compliment:" "" "" "" "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">You see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">We both have a rather southern temper, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that is very important at all!</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece is about prejudices and fanaticism."</seg>
<seg id="28">Today we have the refugees, back then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York inhabitants did not want to.</seg>
<seg id="29">They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were at that time.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday makers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">Until the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament elections will not be held again until the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid to date: summer holidays, heat and land elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The natives, who are to be persuaded by the election fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers in the country, on the way to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not natives, so you can't choose the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="8">Practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, air balloons inflate, flyers and end up counting, only laborious.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again let the people go over themselves.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitions.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels through the country, distributes rosses and chats a bit with the people, just as it already happened to his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "her refugee policy, her" "" "" "" "We create it," "" "" "" "hastened the rise of the right-wing populists, which probably will cost him the beautiful office." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes electoral campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale rallies. the German Chancellor Angela Merkel lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other German states," complained Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR.</seg>
<seg id="22">But it also regrets no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">This, so says Kokert, plays only a subordinate role. "</seg>

<seg id="27">The advice of the CDU-voter Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "you have to go where it hurts, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party needs to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sella has now called his SPD a particularly committed campaign.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Restoration: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5: 30 a.m. and end at about 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site could be relocated to the south as scheduled at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be finished.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commencement of the work carried out for the construction works is also commended, for instance when it comes to the establishment of expeditions.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site has moved to the south on Monday and the blockage of Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is restored, the traffic situation within the village has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The journey through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some serious complaints," says the deputy head manager Florian King responsible for the management of refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherson had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some lorries franken in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the community increased the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant excesses," says King, who made himself aware of the situation himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fast track was around 77 hours per hour in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to a break in revenues makes anyone who asks you to look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the end customer, so for other companies, have hardly any consequences for them.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "" "" "" "slight decline," "" "" "" "but also admits that" "" "" "" "the search engine lacks" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The locals are the most sawed along the road.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" "" "" "" "hard" "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">The sales revenue figures rise to "far above 50 percent."</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the road renovation has cast its operation" "" "" "" "by two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">At all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, it refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regular guests are less often passing by because of the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go there, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele comes back after the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="11">After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has allowed a little time to pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these will be difficult points for the SPD," "" "" "" "the CDU man admits." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">He nevertheless holds this for reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway.</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière presents a few new ideas as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have it partly in themselves: he is planning rapid procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the detention of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are currently recruited in the country should check their smartphones and open social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">In case of denouncements for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers away in order to disguise their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sacred.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them still have an unpleasant impact and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And at some points - in the case of unequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it is not possible to say that the Ansbach and Wuerzburg assassins were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, given the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>
<seg id="29">And things that people deeply occupied were not to be clung out in election campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has enormously moved into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">And yes, there are campaigns.</seg>
<seg id="35">Therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly coming to terms with the issue of inner security.</seg>
<seg id="36">In the past few days, between the two parties it was high.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was only a garristic dispute over the equipping of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some of the interior ministers, in which the department chiefs also demand a Burka ban and a return from dual citizenship.</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't think of a return from the double pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To rediscover it is not expedient.</seg>
<seg id="42">And with a Burka ban he has constitutional concerns.</seg>

<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "Focus" "" "" "" "had reported that Volkswagen is now providing a guarantee for diesel models that have been retrofitted." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">This would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.</seg>

<seg id="28">"VW has fully met the requirements of my Inspection Commission and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "deviations from this are not accepted," "" "" "" "said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to ministry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">VW has assumed the guarantee that no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion will not result in any deterioration and all type approval-relevant vehicle values remain unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="31">Volkswagen, however, does not use the term "guarantee" as it was stated in business trips.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the wide term "warranty" Volkswagen is able to see, for example, a half year after the conversion, for example, a engine failure in a workshop - and that could lead back to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>
<seg id="33">Also in customer interest it is important to avoid that if any other damages which have nothing to do with the scandal-off scandal, such uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations is as stated.</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "guarantee."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before committing to the comment section, in order to reap him under the pseudonym Non-Allee men's middle-age with rough insults, this statement derives from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the widely discussed redevelopment of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but on Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all foresight after the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">Indeed, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby-collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog is a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and shaking wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something better: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill up the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still remains a handful of fantastic record specialist shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera off for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of Files: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, do I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4.000 boards.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, shown above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when he appeared and once more buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably too young to buy them," "" "" "" "he says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media paddle, people who heard about the comeback and set themselves to buy their old records again.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "from the conversations I have led, people usually have dumped their collection around 1998 or 1999." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of the record hightest of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record shops offer a soothing union of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers stumbled on the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to draw back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that recall lucky youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is something for me as a collector so I think it's like many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" "" "an employee flirts with a record stack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use while 7% of those who buy a record do not have turntables.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while strolling through a stack of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Date: three men of middle ages) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-rich.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "" "" "we have people who say," "" "" "" "I have no record player." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the gramophone records, has a lower audience than I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer and sextpacked pop instead of experimental jazz wears out of the speakers - is it good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks weird but psychic traumas are hard to detect if you stand alongside someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of records available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping-shopping than a big shopping-buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or any other way, but the beauty of plates is... "she drives off with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression of wearing jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crossover record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items is more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is the most suitable for luxury objects such as records.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research suggests that the results of YouGov are right, at least in record shops in Soho, they disregard the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their thursday morning with the bumblebees on Berwick Street and the sheets through plates as they avoid the staring gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who rises above the shoulders of suspecting middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the Calais jungle, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary businesses in which people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture Calais argued that these places were to be broken down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would have a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported federations and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille ruled that there would be no legal basis for expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary businesses but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places that was threatened by the tear-down was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is self-serving and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives: in various federal states, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units are tested, which are to be implemented particularly effectively.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement trailers from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can, for example, be used in the areas of accident, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on highway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed police, there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a steady speed limit for compliance with speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days during continuous measurement operation; the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">Laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as travel bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>
<seg id="9">You can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hitch.</seg>
<seg id="10">To ensure that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels in the armoured and by the way also shrink-proof outer cover disappear.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the glitter from vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="12">Since 2015, the trailer has been tested by Vitronic in various federal states and is now also used.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening in the form of Fijis when they were struck here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Flood Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji made a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-down, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Great Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for GB - but will probably not - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former chief of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and dropped the attacks of GBs from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like the captain Tom Mitchell on and Co. started as if you were running in running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 upwards when Osea Kolinisau was in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With only four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right hand corner.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua drove a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presides through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still learns.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB led basic changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sin sultry, whose fans sang, flags paddled and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle ring, the Fijis hugged and kicked crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20-5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a scarce semi-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown took the Boks in the first half to the front, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tacking by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured winning - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the nature of the triumphal procession.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind each gold in the row there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental advances that make the difference and nobody knew whether he would survive this day if he was diagnosed with cancer this day.</seg>

<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>

<seg id="14">The trio was fortunate that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if it is at all the right term.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran on the station - 20 feet, 30 foot, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-rising morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">Panning, which was a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. this is perhaps a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much this means to me how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thanks go to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm that their opponents could not keep up with.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop, there were too much reserve and glover in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very much captured at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to make something happen.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, what we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time out for a year before making decisions about their future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover has to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>
<seg id="36">Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.</seg>
<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that this was my last race.</seg>
<seg id="38">That would have meant too much pressure.</seg>
<seg id="39">It took about six months in London to understand that I am an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="40">It was all so new for me and I was so stressed.</seg>
<seg id="41">It took about four minutes.</seg>
<seg id="42">It feels so much better, "she said.</seg>

<seg id="4">A small, Franconian drinking water association as a model for large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Some time ago it was said in the original sound in a contribution of the Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Unterfranken appreciated the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "the work of the Veities group is" "" "" "" "bayernfar as exemplary." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was a member of the Zweckverband from 31 years, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water association of the Veitensteingruppe, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports approximately 150000 cubic meters of water and provides 32 villages and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The communes are the municipalities of Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for other towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunn mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water attendant in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Better Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organisational skills, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions, to emergency interventions at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events she called for the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and the compensation of the farmers, the restoration of the high containers (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control system (2004) and the remodelling of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was no standstill, and new additions have always been added, because water means living and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation she praised Goehrer's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used much lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he has literally lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veidossteingruppe to the nitrate sinking before the water forum of the Unterfranken districts.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his side, praised Stewart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water gover and he was a faithful cap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well-being and the restructuring of the kennel.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the burglary at the elevated tank at Kirchhof on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because one filled the high container from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">The table is financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ) said: "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask steel producers who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity since the financial crisis of 2008 and a considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer of producers in China threw a mass of steel on the world market in the face of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping Chinese steel groups.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation got a little relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, affixed import duties have an effect on import steel, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, the prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp aimed not to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Division announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced volume went back to the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has accompanied her entire life to Ursel Kipp: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the teacher training college, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors "choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotional and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels well-balanced, cheerful and more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the same time, seniors exercise deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">He who regularly demands his lungs gets out of the dolls even in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby, even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Organisation of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even dementia patients are absinking for long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, a special performance is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate simultaneously on one's voice and to a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you hear through singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem increases through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks you have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a senior championor, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that applies to every age.</seg>

<seg id="8">It is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous examination the team of researchers found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens cries differed with the urgency of their need for help.</seg>

<seg id="11">They were played for a repel of little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger raised kittens, which were raised in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the low sample for meaningful results, the researchers maintain their results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who didn't have their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," said Konerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned around faster to the loudspeaker, when this calls were played by the very regathered kittens.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be congenital or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "" "" "" "biologist said." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.</seg>
<seg id="3">She had suffered from cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but I could leave it again.</seg>
<seg id="4">She planned her homeward journey for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is still unclear whether the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket and in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Hua Hin, located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok, exploded two bombs on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosives went up again, another human being killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in the detonation, near the bathing beach of Patong, which was popular among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country another bomb exploded which killed an urban workers.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coast police.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast demanded several injuries.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a relationship with the explosions in Hua Hin, called it.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings carry the same handwriting," said army general Danai Kritomavee Friday morning in front of journalists.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is too early to comment on possible motives, but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which restricted to limited areas and provinces," "" "" "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather estimated that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities would have received intelligence on upcoming attacks in the south of the country over the past few days - but they did not have been informed of the exact time and place.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ordered their officials all over the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand there are always smaller bombings, but most of the time they are not against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over years by Thailand's king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the present bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Office recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhfara, as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary trips are not carried out in these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence also in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moved towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized the power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest, remembers itself to restore stability and order to the kingdom.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack of the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="2">After several provincial offices, the conservationists in the League put the group under observation.</seg>
<seg id="3">"we see at the 'Identitarian Movement' indications of aspirations against the Free Democratic Principles," said the director Hans-Georg Maaß, the German Press Agency in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thus, immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused in extremist ways.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is why we now observe the movement.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "the" "" "" "" "identical movement" "" "" "" "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="7">It turns against "Multikulti-Wahn," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity by estrangement."</seg>
<seg id="8">Constitutional guards in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "Identitals."</seg>
<seg id="9">Mademos said that his authority was closely coordinated with the provincial offices during the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the" identical movement "try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Principal.</seg>
<seg id="11">Extremists generally try to address them in a youthful language, often with pop music.</seg>
<seg id="12">The faculties of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a futile advertisement for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is meant to address people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly susceptible.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">Most recently, there have been reports from several German states on the contacts of the "Identitaries" to the AfD politicians.</seg>
<seg id="18">Mademos said that he has no knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the constitutional protection, potential contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction by certain individuals who are extremist, and so becomes extremist.</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="23">With a view to the marked increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maaß said he would not speak of new rightist terrorism in this context.</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have noticed that there can be legally-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the 'Freital Group'.</seg>
<seg id="26">It may well be that there are other rightist groups or small groups that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.</seg>
<seg id="27">However, a nationwide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not recognisable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried, Mademos expressed that many attacks went to the account of people who did not appear in the right scene before.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspicious attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated offenders or followers of the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed criminal offences, which previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, which might have been politically indifferent or have voted for example CDU, SPD or Left, who, however, have radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist moods."</seg>

<seg id="1">Rio 2016: ROBEL Kiros Habits becomes an internethite</seg>
<seg id="2">Not always, the Olympic Games or the World Records are the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">At the Aquatics Center the slightly overweighty swimmers from Ethiopia were swam so slowly that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures.</seg>
<seg id="5">He simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckline was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was then promoted to viral interaction.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished with a gap of 48 seconds and finished the 59th place of 59 starters.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries better known.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most sportsmen walk in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called him "Robel of the Wal."</seg>
<seg id="16">Following a "prosperity bump," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun with "Dad Bod" about him.</seg>
<seg id="17">His time, he knocked at a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, played no role.</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with Eric the Eel were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani led the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney for media attention.</seg>
<seg id="20">Unforgettable was the appearance of the Equatorial Guinea buoyancy, when he had to stand alone in a preliminary run over 100 metres of Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before the Olympic and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to €3.44 for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl sewage system; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azort 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the waste water fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget by the District Office of Kulmbach, it was established that undercover is being carried out for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal basis, the Casino market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-effective basis.</seg>
<seg id="6">As of October 1, 2016, the citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Manager Herbert Schmidt showed up to the Board, a new calculation of fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period between October 2016 and September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period will also be equated.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to Schmidt, the serious increase in fee rose by the fact that all three wastewater facilities were relatively small facilities with a very low volume of wastewater, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave effect.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly decreasing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to their age remediation and repair expenditure, not least due to their age, renovation and repair expenses were incurred in a considerable extent during the subsequent calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced because of a damage in the sewage plant in Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">The nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground in the Welschahl pumping station and after nearly 20 years of operation the first sewage pond had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system could be installed to meet the requirements of the water law in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which at the previous calculation were still considerably below the current level in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "stone houses made it clear that in the small waste water attack in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance" "" "" "" "fully hit." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market community of major maintenance costs in the waste water systems, has been spared in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain precarious, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewage-purpose association could not be extended because these facilities are deficient institutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian cartoon is criticized</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapshots tell that this filter is Anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, it allows for Snapchat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blunt, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriage returns to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the past, the Snapchat Filters have criticised themselves for being accused of promoting blackface promotions or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When it proposed a filter to some users this week, who gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics named a racist caricature of Asians - "jaundice."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled this feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism recalled the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely used over the photos, wrote that the filter was "vulnerable and said to be uncomfortable."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellowish face was drawn into the opposite extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stolper.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are in terms of race diverser than their older counterpart - could rather expect to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it used to be the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete their Snapchat account and others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In a record for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that racial controversies reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices in Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either she has no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there, but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say what to do against it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and indicates its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, the Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel manager focusing on underrepresented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">For her part, Zhu said that she will have her Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, establishes Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed an investigation committee of the congress to report in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Army Committee, Secret Service Committees and the Armed Forces Commitment, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts, who reported how superiors their assessments on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State changed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-like information, typically printed on by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly drew a more positive image of US efforts against terrorism as they would have allowed the actual states on the ground and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at the CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, republican member of the House of Representatives, stated.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government tips have given instructions under Obama's instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than facts." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, it's so clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican congressman from Kansas, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to play down the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will be continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of the CentCom reports is underway by the Secretary-General of the Department of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released on Thursday their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," said the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this process," "" "" "" "Mr. Schiff," "" "" "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "" "" "damaged morality among analysts," "" "" "". "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of a White House intervention in the CentCom analysts on a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported from an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, which was taken up by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the congress, while the general inspectors were still in full swing.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations also have a repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under US leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the Islamic State's salaries of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, only foresaw a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government officials stated, that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">CentCom's damn commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">A day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever doing that.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "" "" "she said." "</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know this: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons on the first place, who after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarter final, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">Whatever the game on Saturday, the American women triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time she had a hockey stick in her hands (her two older sisters play sports at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">The following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team, began to turn things better.</seg>

<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pluck the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door row in the first half of the game with a back cover from the near area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into the game without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the match from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and drew the ball into the gate to give the female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late as it is, there are the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel permanent and inevitable, a fast relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is passed from the wristwatch to the swimmer to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the television, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the waiting line in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics and a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not match any event alike.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest attitude for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although jumping on the trampoline was an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it became so sparsely noticed for the last 16 years that many of those I had interviewed did not know that it was an olympic sport at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had won an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain type of outsider, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an experienced enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means much like "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring Winner jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympics program, they are evaluated according to the execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio against each other.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold need to go further, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and down, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They chase not only the finish line or the output wall, but also an additional high goal in the TV transmission: the world or the olympic record.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatigued even when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing spell.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It's as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 1.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday also at 1.00 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and the object qualification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently proposed - according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr Dooley expects a new fan community to breathe.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia met with the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police during shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was ruthless according to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed on umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos being circulated about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security men hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council now demands a thorough investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa Project Manager of the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terror threats over the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example of democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or pushed into the deserts of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest," "" "" "" "said Zeyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold over power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Ogao Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which in recent years were enforced more or less, could exploit the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of tinkage under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services have improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they stop.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered so much to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from aedics mainly Christian high-lands, prospered in politics and economics, while they exploited the Orosei, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to co-ordinate under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orom.</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amperas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is Meles Zenawi's death.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death on a non-publicized illness in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Contrary to Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil was in 2005, after thousands protest against elections which, according to analysts, apparently were messed up by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the following raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in combating poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal misconception of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an ampersist city, attacked businesses from Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even if it announced recently that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West definitely wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile territory.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "this," "" "" "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "" "" "is a very thin atrocity." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has been founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification gave rise to new questions about the communication capabilities of Republicans' presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings forth his fellow combatants, who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to declare statements that he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump left behind the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Tweet was the opposite to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews he meant the accusation entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican Presidential Candidate wanted to know nothing about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism levelled down on Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on account of falling survey values on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">Talking about Twitter he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later said "Of course I thought it was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans how they arrive, and then, if necessary, clarify" depending on how the reaction falls. "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe that he is clever enough to keep his statements very vague, so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump adopted an even more corrosive sound, as its survey values declined further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump in general tries to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while emphasizing the focus of attention in the recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions into the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent principals, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "" "" "Mr Giuliani said he was questioned about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hinterbänkler, completely false and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the mainstream republicans argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to expand by aggressively taking control of the situation in the Middle East.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and taking action against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "he ridiculed the" poor "" "" "" "" twilight "" "" "" "" television experts trying to understand him and said, "You can't!" "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trumps excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the president's office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a skinny cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay cash that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices were pushed out of Bedford Avenue store front.</seg>
<seg id="4">The soap Cherie store, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a rival town.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is apart and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is change, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old cafés, the owner and managing director of the new cafe.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outside office, he was excited to do so, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb works the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same bulbs from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and saucers.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmets, Roosevelt had a fiaible for sophisticated delicatessen on Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was slightly more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as a dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was a Chinese cuisine in the USA, while in her book "97 Orchard" it was told about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive branches, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered minced roast, this found the couple fitting for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," explains Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheese and poppy bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE was grinning.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it must have been in the stomach such as lead," "" "" "" "he said." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You Can Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male Fellows and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" stands out for the ways that the country turned around to be no longer the land of Cockaigne.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central, tense topic for the Americans," "" "" "" "told him why he and his wife wanted to write about it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and casserdants became the staple foods, the casserole was a "wonderful way to reuse food leftovers," as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for many years, became a rare luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tested, as a calorie-rich and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen sense.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which also includes recipes, brick is a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter, too.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular additive at lunchtime," says Coe.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "Ziegelman continues:" "" "" "" "it was surreal." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - abruptly attacked the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household members" and the challenge of transforming pamphlets like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, like President Herbert Hoover's lass-me-cake food attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he openly applauded the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he fed as the million-millionaire man from the world to whom he became.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food was discarded once the country returned to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, declared brickman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law in writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "she was afraid of the waste of food," "" "" "" "said Coe." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "" "" "bricks remembered:" "" "" "" "she really made people ill." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the vortex of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plates were cleared near Eisenberg's, they and Coe produced a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plum recipe that President Roosevelt ate at midday.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is called Prune Whip," "" "" "" "he added," "" "" "" "he added that it was a usual trick to miss a chic name." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="51">Each dived somewhat reluctantly a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Surprisingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland sharks only get offspring with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the north Atlantic Ocean, an average of 1,220 meters in an hour.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6m / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this lifestyle shaped by slowness seems to be a recipe for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal "Science" at any rate from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," explains Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist assumed long that Greenland sharks are stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland sharks are hard to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear in the winter at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow-bends measured them, when they buried six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver, which torkel from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks which fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the largest size was 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals they analyzed with the carbon-14 method the lens nucleus of the sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks were remarkably carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons shone large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland sharks in their lens nucleus, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts resulting from cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 cm long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign the length to an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks obviously allow at least one and a half centuries time with the reproduction.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year old Greenland, whose bacon stuck on the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals also often runs on inflamed ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often particularly large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the Evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London.</seg>

<seg id="16">In addition, the rent for premium commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main River.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure, as well as less criminality.</seg>
<seg id="18">In a ranking of the corporate consultancy Mercer, the city is ranked 7th, Luxembourg in place 19, Dublin in No.33 and Paris on 37th place.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if quality of life is a question of preference: "with its already strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract other banks and investors," said the IW.</seg>
<seg id="20">But London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit-Votum, my economic researchers.</seg>

<seg id="2">Hillary Clinton released its tax declaration on Friday, which resulted in the democrats' presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.</seg>
<seg id="3">In 2015, the Clinton Foundation donated $1 million for charitable purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton recorded $5.3 million in Redeemorariums; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon & Schuster for their term of office in the State Department.</seg>

<seg id="7">In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false phrases and retreats regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declarations.</seg>

<seg id="12">Drumps critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises questions relating to assets, his donations for charitable organisations, his business people and various other connections, especially with Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">Clinton has already thrown himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday, in which high-ranking Republican Trump calls for his tax return.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the counseling unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time until the next Rome pilgrimage of all the ministrants in two years, the Church of the Order of Ministers, St. Anna, decided to prepare and carry out a long-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and it was finally decided in favour of the bishopric town of Fribourg, where, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opening of mercy of the Freiburg Minster.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and the sepulchre, and the sepulchre, and the halfling rooms, went their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before the parish priest saved the pilgrims in a small ceremony at St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb he was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Our Lady is standing and so the pilgrimage from Münster began.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at field-crossing, chapels or churches always again and again to sing a song from specially compiled pilgrim-song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the overnight stays the parish offices of the local parish priests were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were assuring for a tasty and starchy dinner and the breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The day after that, one stepped up the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but had to climb some 500 metres in high heat and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a common barbecue at the bathing lake in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God thanked God.</seg>
<seg id="19">The Minis by cooperator Markus Obert was welcomed at the evening mass in Münster.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner rained last night in the men team sprint at Velodrom in Rio, when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy made himself to Eigen. the boy proudly made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy scored the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after winning in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the withdrawal of Hoys, only a modest sixth place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did so in good time as a Hindu.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement generated a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed, when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner played an Olympic-ord in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap was tight, Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear in order to slow him down and enable him to keep pace with Kenny and, above all, Skinner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic-ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the side Kenny and Hoys, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally dropped onto the train.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later refuted this statement and there was no objection of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">This time there was no such problem with such an outstanding victory.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "it feels like London with all the GB flags." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have been so bad with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it's in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would mean Kenny, who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny will take part in the sprint that will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said," "" "" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "he said:" "" "" "" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should become a knight." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where the focus will be on Wiggins.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had argued yesterday with officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the same women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a bunch of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly remarkable representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas played in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and mobbing allegations as well as retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite like the legendary reputation GBs, which at the perfect moment reached its climax, will be repeated.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus lifts all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20 year prevention subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 workplaces in the Alcoa facility in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 workstations -direct and indirect - could be jeopardized in a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to Domino effects as the melting process consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed Point Henry Schmeling, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, who supplies the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, stated that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions.</seg>

<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force from November 2016.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in the 17 fiscal year," "" "" "" "said the electricity supplier." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="18">AGL announced that it had already written the value of the contracts in his annual subscription of $187 million in "anticipation of termination."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the "ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt" is not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation of why it resigned from the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Karthehian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the U.S. Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran to Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," "" "" "" "Kendall wrote." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="6">This is the cliché gesture of almost every birthday child of a children's show (Seacre brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the existence of Kardhians has certainly begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold out edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a volume similar to a picture book rather like a fashion magazine, the output attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the waltz 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine were still seeping before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss include women who were already on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "" "" "celebrities who are" "" "" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "" "" "on the cover." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of its generation - falls below the previous category, it is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who are in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenner's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always something tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called her "Mistresses of the Moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (September 18) there are considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CDU.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute Insa for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could scarcely govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to a survey, the party is still smiling shortly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is contentious between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be 19 percent (18.4 per cent before); the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of slight losses, the Greens were reluctant to return to Schwerin Landtag in spite of slight losses (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">In each case, NPD and FDP were not represented in the parliament with 3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies showed only 23 percent (2011 election: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU achieved only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">It still lies behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">With 14 percent, the AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successor dominates the world today - its maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was rather palpable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory was eight megabytes at the beginning, which would suffice for approximately two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="10">For a few Euro, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but somehow they come from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in the west pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the access to web pages was possible by HTML-Browser, even though agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the cell phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the era of smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blockage are the same as a "cat and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockages on its desktop, Adblock Plus published a blogpost in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding for its adverts in order to make it difficult to detect advertisements about which part of the site is advertising.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to circumvent the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blogpost, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-fro battle between the open source community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has embarked on the fight is a strong indication of how worrying signmakers have become for the industry.</seg>

<seg id="2">The victim lay in the middle of the night on the motorway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police are calling witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday was overdriven by a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman was in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is obvious that at the age of 49, a Swiss woman who has been convicted of several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself.</seg>
<seg id="7">She still died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">Several drivers have already heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police told them that they, as well as every witness of the incident, urges him to report.</seg>
<seg id="9">An investigation procedure was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles dedicated Hofstetter to Le Tribune de Geneve.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "this is something the public prosecutor has to decide," "" "" "" "said Hofstetter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not responsible.</seg>
<seg id="14">In each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the motorway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="15">Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after having crossed and killed a man who was located on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014.</seg>
<seg id="16">The 22-year-old victim had drunk and had become unconscious on the street, took the court.</seg>
<seg id="17">The court found that the policewoman -- who had replied to an emergency call -- ran into a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely unusual and unforeseeable situation," said the judge.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus probably once inhabitable.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies by NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether Venus could have recorded sublime conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and still turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably referred to more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variation to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun, which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus will expose its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS Scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degree cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought about a history of Venus, which resembles the evolution that was previously thought by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was supposedly habitable, Venus -- over several billion years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans have evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen withdrew, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide withdrew with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler's Space Telescope has helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotational rates under the star cluster of the Pleiades cluster.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help the astronomer to understand why stars revolve around different rates in the star cluster as well as in what connection the rotational periods are associated with planet origin.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other Sternenhaufen we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Reull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Sternenhaufen of the Pleiades lies 445 lightyears distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated some 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak-rate-rates, these poignant stars encounter large amounts of star-winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star alerts, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of every star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The newest catalogue of rotational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars turn more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the cluster of stars of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Pleiades cluster offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="17">There is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how, how, when and why stars would slow down their rates of rotation and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes."</seg>

<seg id="2">Blurred: because of a positive test of doping, weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland must not start in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.</seg>
<seg id="4">A wiped athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping events are known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critically polluted athletics competitions these messages come to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Criminal Court CAS confirmed their expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday the 18-year-old finished fourth in the final about 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the handrails over 50 m of Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data theft: hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware-defense specialist Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been at least once, in part multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software in the past twelve months.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data again.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specialize in attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be blackened is considerably higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world."</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the painting programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred in the past months startling swiftly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and deletes the originals permanently.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the receivables of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end-turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of CryptoMorning Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher when a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies affected reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely interrupting business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany there have already been several hospitals victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "" "" "don't pay, you only support the problem," "" "" "" "explains Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay will get their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the perpetrators of the perpetrators in the face of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmail users and come to the conclusion that the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decipher sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively high-risk gains from the Ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski stated by the antivirus provider SOPHOS: "a single person can write a Ransomware within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software modular system to the actual testers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The so-called malware-kits were created using malware, advice, and additional tools for a single, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "included is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "" "" "says Wisniewski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmailers then look for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log into one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs you to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals engage in spamming with the spread," explains Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes Survey are confident to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful recovery, perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "" "" "explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="41">According to the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz, Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blockaded heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one wallows eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning is already far ahead of the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">It's anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German society for sleep and sleep medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you understand for the time being, however, is the Insomnia, that is, a sleeping disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the Executive Board at the German Dental Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind them can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medications.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is sleep disorder an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "very early awakening is particularly frequent in the case of depression," "" "" "" "says Weeß." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, those who have a herniated disc can be bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begin to ponderate about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">If you are not sleeping well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired on the day, you should go to the doctor, don't throw away any fire.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments such as stomach or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to relieve sleeping disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There are few low-seated dormitories in Germany, emphasised Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Center for Sleep Medicine at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is why one should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep and what will happen?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for the examination in the sleeping laboratory, doctors advise against snoring with breathing replacements, for pathological day fatigue, for sleepwalkers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"please do not take a nap," says Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="30">After the calming you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera monitors the sleeping area on the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a few adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">A blast counts: regular sleeping and standing up times, do not sleep long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television to sleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive to it.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented on Facebook for the disappointing cutting of the DSV team at Olympis.</seg>
<seg id="3">In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the Doha Short-Track World Championships and at the same time set up his first world record.</seg>
<seg id="4">Now the former DSV-athlete Markus Deibler faces his protracted ex-team-mates via Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 €bonus and a jungle King 150,000 €, nobody should be surprised about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on his Facebook page at night.</seg>
<seg id="6">The transport system in the swimming-sport is bad, however, the doping controls are very good.</seg>
<seg id="7">With this we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not exactly look at doping or even operate it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," "" "" "" "he continued." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">If he wanted to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered already nine months before his first launch of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).</seg>
<seg id="10">This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.</seg>
<seg id="11">"those who do not have a certain time before WM / OS can't be controlled by independent controllers of the WADA / FINA must not participate," says Hamburg's election Hamburger, who meanwhile operates an ice cream parlor.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a couple of lime trees, in between yet another cobblestone pavement: the Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem like this, but the police count them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "someone has sprayed" "" "" "" "ugly" "" "" "" "on the facade of a grey house." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Opposite a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, will be built: by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">In recent weeks articles about this "trendy district," as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are being preferred with burning cars.</seg>
<seg id="6">Reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, on the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, particularly Berlin's inner senator Henkel had expressed himself for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, patrolling the police three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers were renovating the rooms on behalf of the unknown landlords.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road seems peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain themselves in front of Späti.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are especially generously affected by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern for increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a neighborhood that mostly caused police protection from vandaliating left.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin senator and the police distinguish between the landowners and their neighbors, does not seem to exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional workers "district, which still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty in comparison with the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">In 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost all of the Mainzer Street close to the Riga City.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was swept under a large police command in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer have been legalized and are partly inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and polliners from all over the world: now residents from GDR times and former home owners share their Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them on inserted discs or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with colour-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "no other road was mentioned this year together with the words" "" "" "" "Left-Autonomous Violence." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: crimes such as personal injury are according to statistics almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are caused by material damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house for 17 years in addition to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As far as violence is concerned, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who were not destined for that.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it in the Rigaer any longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here, one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer moved consciously into the Riga-Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her that local residents get their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly strained the interpretation sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer the road continues to be taken away: with faceless new buildings in former building-holes, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "these are ultimately condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well searched here," "" "" "" "she says." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" "" "" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what can you do if someone never listens to it?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for the drawn ones who are freeing themselves about colour bombings: the Hauschild family projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Those who draw near should be aware of this - just like someone who moves into a pub area, which can badly complain about noise there.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new Refugee Representative</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organiser.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Ombudsman for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working groups refugees, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is there, the ice-loving woollen-sow, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mockering but rather focused on the multitude of tasks desired - meant when the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an executive power with a talent for languages and people connected with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, just a self-reliant lust for wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent point limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it was high time," "" "" "" "says Regine client, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers will soon be available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights, which have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to put the refugees in your own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Municipalities themselves must bear the costs of the construction, rent or the renovation of these accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Office of Agriculture to the Commune and Jobcenters.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord is willing to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it doesn't work so far, you depend on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common dwellings must be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be trained or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," said Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do charitable work - and that motivates and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">That is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here, administration and volunteers are also involved here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "it is crucial that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They need to explain to refugees that it will take time to bridge the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach will not be able to work and be useless, and he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are problems, too, says customer honestly, "people in whom nothing works." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences fear radicalisation, even in a small community such as Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customers clearly say "what some naive call" might be. a residual risk could and would not exclude them.</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also a matter of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would make them complete.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "" "" "" "says Regine customer." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the local and local volunteers must look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the uranium has already been utilized to integrate the existing people wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "" "" "" "" "but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
