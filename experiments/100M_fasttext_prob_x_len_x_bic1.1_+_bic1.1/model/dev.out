Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
both wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
through the deal adverti@@ sed by Obama , the Iranian nuclear programme has wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial talk , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been discussed with Obama . a meeting had declined with reference to the election in Israel at that time .
in an emergency call , professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the cell phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal emergency at some point afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the university , the students and teachers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty encompasses 17 members , and many students visited courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something with him was wrong . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house but Johnson said that he believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the long@@ standing friends Lam@@ bs called him to be intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in High School and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar .
at that time it was the s@@ warm of women .
all girls melted away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house , adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a po@@ orer audience .
there was no indication that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the shelter and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are saying that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that Lamb in his call Pr@@ enti@@ ss was calling Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas seasonal employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says he will give a chance to work more hours with employees and seasonal workers .
the company said that it is planning to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers throughout the country . during the Christmas season 2014 , more than 45@@ ,000 workers have been hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees will rise from October to December .
while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furnis@@ h shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox stir@@ s up his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat next to me is empty , and it is becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated crow@@ ning and a length from it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict that lasted almost five years , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN president ur@@ ges all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in poll@@ s down , it doesn &apos;t work ( yet ) .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask themselves what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s lead was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom only won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to drop their dollars to overthrow it .
here are some current survey values that indicate that real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of ten Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 would say they were &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they would &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same thing about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive asser@@ tions , 52 percent of the Irish voters who are becoming Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , such as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first country of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money hats , Republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination most likely , after a pol@@ l / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination by only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , a large number of GO@@ P voters have seen Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gather around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is disper@@ sed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he gained 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly committed their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say that never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , immigration was the pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump vital His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as the in@@ filtration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounts for roughly half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider compared to someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Registry / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ lish anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here on the look@@ out trail is the most expensive residential complex - with a view of the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ att .
in the street , one square meter of a roof@@ ed roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; in Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - that is , the high price .
a new study shows in which specific areas a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ ler has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
two scor@@ pi@@ pers in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller pa@@ w the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es scored ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth launch success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received gra@@ cious assistance from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto during his 28th hit in the Champions League to Bavarian leadership , which allowed a bul@@ let of the World Champion to happen as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated presentation without sh@@ aming .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including prestigious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they cour@@ age@@ ously went to work with their offensive efforts , but often too inno@@ cent@@ ly .
the attacks were often induced by the shift of the game on the left @-@ hand Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right , when his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the upper right @-@ hand corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion announced the possible 2 : 0 .
the best times in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker stri@@ ker , Ide@@ ye Brown , hit Poland &apos;s head ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with the knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set up con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous sticks .
but at go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye about the lan@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before New Guardian , guar@@ ola made a four @-@ chain tri@@ cycle with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside at first .
the World Cup Champion had given the green light only after the final training , &quot; said Sport Chief Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something else out of it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
also at the first change , guar@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller added another .
in front of the game it came to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their audience block provoked the followers of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured in the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : when doing so , the risk decreases rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.6 to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking is a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , the authors stress . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take over ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smokers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have affected the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking can increase the risk of early dental ou@@ tage .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rem@@ n@@ ants of historical buildings have excav@@ ated , said Museum Manager Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always consul@@ ted as a specialist for archaeological site preservation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found their findings .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
in addition to the rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves which probably belonged to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the railway station in ho@@ stages , the Federal Police asks the population for assistance .
early on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 am the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it was severely injured by the capture of the train .
she was treated in emergency and brought to a hospital by emergency services .
on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal crossing of the young woman there is no evidence available to the dev@@ our@@ ing officials .

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to tigh@@ ten the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TT@@ IP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds significantly to more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the competent EU Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström during the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new Court of App@@ eal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are to be part of the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is planned .
it would allow it to appeal against judgement .
so far , the parties involved agreed with one another to arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent months debate it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ström commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work according to their own information on an international investment judgment .
there could , for example , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is mainly demanded by large corporations , is considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that allows companies to set damages on the tax@@ pay@@ ers , break national laws , or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act reported the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first of all , it was critici@@ zed that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ ining ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into consideration vital points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way .
the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement were still unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US until now .
originally , a framework for the agreement should have been at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy folk artist recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story from different places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative Irish .
published in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; will appear clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late 60s , but can always drift into a great opul@@ ent drift at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row .
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) a nationwide masterpiece is released in 2005 .
bor@@ dering on ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any ann@@ u@@ ity list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively .
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
from the smaller clubs long ago , the stage shows become the colorful spectacle of ne@@ on brow@@ band and big fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in a dark Ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and it is possible to disc@@ ard the &quot; record . &quot;
only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens hum@@ bles himself , acousti@@ cally plays few older songs and eventually tends to be thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the sc@@ andal of the Prime Minister
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s ques@@ tioning will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to give his debut in the prime minister &apos;s questions and put on David Cameron for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs close by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the decision of the Labour Party to pers@@ ist on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the centre of several front @-@ page stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n speaker said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow @-@ cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of Shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they rely on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour intends to make changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and retired minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box during the last decade .
the Labour Party , who has promised another policy approach , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too con@@ front and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the stri@@ fe with bar@@ b@@ arians , and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow economy minister will be represented if he does not participate , for example if Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Comm@@ ons , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ gran@@ ce with the Prime Minister was considered the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds Incre@@ ased by Acc@@ eler@@ ated W@@ age Growth in the United Kingdom
in parallel with this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller policy objective .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has made estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ be@@ v was received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were up 0.@@ 9 % higher according to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports bond company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs for his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster introduces Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato twe@@ eter
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and in the potato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da Movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; which he had accidentally seen on television .
since then , a barbecue sp@@ lash is spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; that is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile registered the idea at the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash launches Boden@@ stan@@ dig campaig@@ ning for the fight against algae inf@@ estation
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufactur@@ er@@ S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to disclose further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , however , believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will grab about five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ a said Mr K@@ ier@@ a said , the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market share in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan reveals that I@@ GA shop@@ pers are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s food and food trade , which has about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt to sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to provide I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s Chief Executive Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging remedi@@ ation programs are to grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; fell into the spotlight by the not@@ orious argument of K@@ yr@@ gios with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon thereafter Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated two times by the arbit@@ er , with Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have sm@@ ashed K@@ yr@@ gios , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp has@@ tily beat a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic at the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious of is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little in the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a tie , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick made the climb very fast , pointing out people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he goes up in the eyes of the public and he deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .

Hungary explains the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to get illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Serbian officials with indignation .
the people who had fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations went up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter suspended over them , the migrants sc@@ ared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c , at a meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the tor@@ tured Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of emergency in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plans the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also specify greater prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but reports from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by har@@ ming the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are able to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos hu@@ gged the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to get into it .
about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands ab@@ ode outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s former Secretary of State continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won &apos;t win over to the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is can@@ did@@ acy for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinions determine which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections were reduced .
their support for the men has fallen dramatically , and S@@ anders is only back here with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage for democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the country &apos;s democratic voters say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more strongly mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top channel Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that they have the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice president has a potential for the presidential office in the balance shell , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do so .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to channel for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head start to S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election , but this figure has dropped by 78 per cent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
yet , with the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call on questions about elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the past month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the prim@@ aries is unacceptable .
the demo@@ cra@@ cies or potential candidates provide good results in some of the key features of voters in their party &apos;s prim@@ aries .
maj@@ orities consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den best cuts in hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe him .
democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister continues , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is content .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them amongst registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks for guidance .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to U.S. poll@@ s behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose a dramatic level of support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey of Tuesday .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump amongst Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ cons@@ ini Scott Walker , who fell the lowest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % in third place .
the margin of error in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - with 19 % support from Republi@@ cans , behind the ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
by contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even come up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bor@@ ns
almost two years after a student died in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania while a student died , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly warned an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by the authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a charge of murder third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with illegal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this sanc@@ tioned , we will also take this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed raises interest rates
a rate of interest comes , and the hous@@ et@@ se is shaken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months following the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the US central bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the market , however , market participants could realize that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal al@@ ti@@ tudes , but still at too low levels to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends as to how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of inser@@ tions increases things for a while volati@@ le .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets to be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may once again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after net interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rate rise , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gic at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the return begins to l@@ essen .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that could not previously exist and ha@@ sten a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate rise in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 decreased only twice the nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants have taken a interest rate in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading accounts for a 25 percent chance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all under@@ mining cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ aires were put in the shadows very quickly after the beginning of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rate increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than for shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bor@@ rowing , yields seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the Elev@@ ation cycle , the bond traders immediately fell , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
highly suscep@@ tible bonds often yield better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , mixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , credit margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all features of the market , if the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar is making their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet achieved an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit from rising dollars outside of the pure share games .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts differ from how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
the Parliament &apos;s right @-@ wing member critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster for its &quot; reduction &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; maintains a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the station to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do .
the conserv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham , also said to the BBC Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ ca@@ ster is &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t learn anything about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work on the audience than it did in the past , because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sports , to tramp@@ le the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall was insist@@ ing that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment is star@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to issue the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the revenue pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
for over a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is evidence now that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G selling index to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments such as at home on the sofa .
but now this is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers return their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium saw that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online , rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane crash killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of the vast Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sh@@ ee .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the way to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went past the holy place , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral when the Saudi king ordered a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the disaster , which left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 people who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central mo@@ sch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane was down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to become the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group would not have left the arm of the crane when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was prohibited abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the Cran@@ s that pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner court yard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which took place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also included the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mo@@ sh@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and is taking over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son that was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amidst heavy winds and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said that 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to be paid to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe has increased
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets throughout the country
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is said that Br@@ its lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home .
if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ people from Eastern Europe , which offer services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
King@@ fis@@ her therefore plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which focus on tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions were taken by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , making more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have to move this stronger to a balance .
basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK leader listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in the half @-@ year profit and sales after the group bl@@ amed the cost of closing the shops .
King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up 200 new branches because of the trends .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian vol@@ ley @-@ runner @-@ runner A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public procurement on Wednesday .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ sed in the preliminary examination that the accused were used for private use in the years 2006 to 2011 funds of association accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence presented that the association was not incurred as an asset at any time .
the sports officials had charged only expense and the sports club for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or lock it ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the B@@ read Occup@@ ation of the Financial Office .
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance policies as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , with appropriate financial success , compens@@ ations for reimbur@@ sement of expenses have been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been in the account .
this was the reason why l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed deviations appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the processes .
the accounts and austerity books administered the two def@@ end@@ ants together , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed to the association in detail asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the funding , it was important to have had the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one of the officials began investigations because of abuse of office , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was credited to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wanted to know the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said that he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the public prosec@@ utor in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim return . &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary told him that he never had a cent salary , he counted only mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he charged the association € 1,000 per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused could not show accurate records for the early years .
these claims were no longer kept after an audit in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the shifts were made in cash , so he had to go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ St@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the enterprise .
there is no end to the sub@@ missions of the US computer giant Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
this will save costs of $ 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion ) , and the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had a workforce of roughly 30@@ 2,000 .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share declined by 2.3 percent .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group is currently spl@@ itting itself into a new company with printers . this is how the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , according to Lenovo , continued to decline .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
thus the revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and increasingly do business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .

the direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , overwhel@@ m@@ ingly exp@@ el : 54 per cent said , 35 percent expressed approval .
the fact that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with the Syrian authorities , Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad , le@@ aned 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be responsible for this .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Water Li@@ ghts against several hundred murdered refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ ews D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ ej@@ ector was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials stopped at first un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly pepper spray .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
in this way , the group was dis@@ b@@ anded .
the refugees have now withdrawn somewhat cau@@ tious .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees s@@ unk into themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US Central Bank is coming together two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make the most important decision whether interest rates have been raised or not for the first time for almost a decade .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view , was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has set interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
victims of death at the Delta State University
after firing and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers back to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but it will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen kno@@ cked him surrounded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was working online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; he will not go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed herself with a shot .
lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University , such as his li@@ fes@@ c@@ law on the University &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the trade union .
Lufthansa buil@@ ts its corporate structure and upgrades the Eu@@ row@@ ings Che@@ aper .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to result in a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not have a board of directors for passenger operations in the future .
the Eu@@ row@@ ings cheap airline should be developed as independently as possible .
in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the future .
with the new setup , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
until now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex .
the airline operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations will be resum@@ ed after the court stop on this Thursday .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven League of Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this gave the left external def@@ enders to cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t hope Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s horri@@ ble - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , it lasts for six months , and it won &apos;t play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

with the European Championship in France , the UK defender has an additional incentive to recover until the next June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very serious injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear it is a very serious injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the way in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very badly there . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister opted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and well except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , returns instead a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams by reading . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel , and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees @-@ prone , Th@@ need kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the name @-@ giving Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , sn@@ ug creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral circular office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ onian employees , but there were no further immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
to b@@ ump into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Side is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity at test @-@ level , is an option for the attack .
this is related news : Adam Ly@@ th turns out from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully , if he kno@@ cks out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not produce so good achievements , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ ons was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he is a drummer , whom I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this naturally depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest mos@@ ques next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin punch and receive four Qui@@ cks , di@@ pped up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ dena perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred of us straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as he played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing room , even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the one @-@ day@@ makers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made with light hearts .
Bre@@ x@@ it ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could win on Zul@@ u if the economy goes into a sl@@ ack until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always full of their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend who wishes to look outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is one of the allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened during the over@@ drive long outs like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist righ@@ tist government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will plu@@ ck one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers might even intentionally not plan helpful comments , fully in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Britain has gained nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they did not during the 1975 referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may feel weak at Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ma@@ dness Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly aps on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take time , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC he has left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it kindly - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int @-@ tendency and the wild cor@@ rid@@ ors of Toronto &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ismus may well say yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week when the boy sc@@ ou@@ ting fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
whatever the cur@@ ving bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with its B@@ enn@@ ite Siege economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic stri@@ fe .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start any campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense in all their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin be wasted with political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can all be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I remembered at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critici@@ ze public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month res@@ or@@ ted to the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; where he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Control ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not delivered , but there are several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the Tab@@ ac line of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions is discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims were already re@@ acted earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we satisfy our national jurisdiction .
BBC to give up East@@ er , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to do the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers such as BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus Communications Committee on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least put your production to programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have to see how this is supposed to be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows return what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart speech in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ enders to sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can rather not measure the audience , but they can argue if they go on their apparent missions to justify four billion £ &quot; radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think , we all think that there is a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their ethics mission , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and maintain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and discussing this in public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by means of sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on motor neur@@ ons which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ č@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that a day could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , reinforce the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
after applying ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with pulses of light .
but Cal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ azi@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .
in September , a flock of gun dealers will drive with the DL@@ R ... Customers will be asked to help stop the trade show .
the 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped distribution in London and took advantage of &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ -@@ pack of Allen keys , which is claimed to gain access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;
transport for London doesn &apos;t find this poster &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; funny .
one of the par@@ o@@ dy displays produced by special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol Designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists join activists within protest movements to work and realize that they have to move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters greeted the commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist who works for free as well .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned around the advertising for the trade fair - through a legend of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with bright colours and animation , it remains stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors plot fantas@@ tically eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .
in a press release Sa@@ ab reveals an order from the US army on &quot; the AT@@ 4@@ CS RS shot from the shoulder . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uniqu@@ ely shaped &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; head that delivers outstanding reflection effects inside the target . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whatever this causes , it will not be pleasant .
eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entry into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell whence you are , whether and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; frank@@ ly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ ited and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people go .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night venues and communal Hang@@ outs , but they are also the places where people dress and decorate their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away in order to get the energy I consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send it a text message instead of kno@@ cking it on .
apro@@ pos do@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an an@@ alog@@ ous b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are among the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbours if it would matter to them to make drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too much embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , ran@@ som them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they draw all together friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow dw@@ eller is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
teach by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but never leave someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place their keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ ack@@ y their hol@@ dings at the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single mothers , pick@@ pockets
the property entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner is building row houses for people who do not have much money in the central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room but also the mother and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ educ@@ ating mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you can still build good and good today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are forced to enter the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ lier believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ asi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great part .
in view of the flow of refugees we need sufficient living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ d : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ d : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without plot .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have successfully completed my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking regulation .
cre@@ amy .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no room for it .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced building project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable apartments ?
Gil@@ bert : true : we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the poor servant .
I &apos;ll show you how to build even today cheap and good .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then selecting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; software update &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait to either wait until the rush returns or attempt to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might switch off half way and could lead to an interruption of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes @-@ team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup @-@ II stressed in front of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the vice world champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on has already won seven of the twelve races of the season and will also launch the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on won the race .
it is still unclear whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Great Prize of Singapore .
for days , a vap@@ our bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to K@@ ur .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann has supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation made by Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office seeking direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old people &apos;s centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new lod@@ gings office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will receive immediate sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as the nursing insurance or services of the health and nursing staff .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have been finding that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently many benefits of the insur@@ ances are not taken into account , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner in J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; out@@ patient service .
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this is because it constitutes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular soci@@ alised get @-@ together . &quot;
in this way , the social foundation makes a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as far as possible .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was located at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the site of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and drove past demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male member .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , one examined the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be brought to hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller acqu@@ ires Practice Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen .
furthermore , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are lucky : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ gh@@ ausen on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows reti@@ res , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his side in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 .
it was a sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her medical education at the Ver@@ den hospital and wants to get into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ lers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was ready I just called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller had the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the tr@@ ash cans bought the house with practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ fold father , Frank Müller , grew up there , following his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a general practitioner in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz district and is involved in voluntary work on the DR@@ K @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared as of September 19 .
while the surgeon is working as a family doctor , Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Boden@@ stron@@ gh@@ ausen , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as home@@ owners .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l .
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler will receive a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deputy Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the practice of Fel@@ steh@@ eat every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor practice .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy still remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ halt .
if no successor found himself , she would have gone .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos;s talk hour , by the way , continue to look especially in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their par@@ ting , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors have practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows rec@@ alls .
after the long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly still see many patients , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until now I have always pressed myself against gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Mari@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany , and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , however , did not see this very much in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia is to intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to prevent its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to pass the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly meeting police cars with new refugees .
it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t direction to Croatia , compl@@ em@@ enting Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people reject certain routes : &quot; neither we can , nor do we want to do this , &quot; said it .
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way through Serbia all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route of Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared adequate plans for potential compensation situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control options . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees now wish to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not be at this time to deal with very high numbers of refugees .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing country maps on which alternative routes through Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals accused of having provided insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , in@@ sider trading should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over $ 100 million was launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other accused were perpet@@ u@@ ated in the case .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are said to have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , partly fast pac@@ emaker , partly comfortably stroll .
you control the two stops of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
vibrant , magnificent life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I dying I want .... &quot;
with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
while some people spontaneously acc@@ use the chal@@ k and &quot; read my life , &quot; &quot; read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long &quot; , others remain short , read , say phrases as &quot; I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again on the br@@ ink of discussions about the action in itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work of Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband sponsor of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid .
therefore , this public effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that everyone does not want to express himself publicly on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death continues to be afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people .
an app@@ rais@@ al shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral service is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sum@@ mon@@ ed by the call of Hon@@ or , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives are accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
all are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle well with her task and the experiences and experiences he has made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as further education and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ d@@ ants .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes can also be recorded on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply beh@@ em@@ oth lowered its profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its land transport service .
the company also said that she plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claimed to earn a win between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a fac@@ t@@ set survey of € 10,@@ 84 .
the lower outlook is despite the price increases that amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , despite higher elev@@ ations for heavy and large packages rising from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reductions , higher revenue , and because of growth in online trading .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; solid yields will yield , if one considers the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than those of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , roughly the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted twelve analysts commissioned by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s surv@@ eyed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in the international priority shipment which brought revenue in its unit express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 per cent , but operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the central bank has a double mission from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself insur@@ es the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of increasing .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value rose by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would cancel the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argued that a rate rise would calm the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but the financial markets all over the world gathered at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cho@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , and the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the level of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when the interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the last few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be taken into account technically in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered turbul@@ ence around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global asset management strategy for En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
in 1998 / 1999 , Lack@@ er , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , called for an increase in interest rate , cited decisions as an example in the years 1998 / 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia prompted the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three meetings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market share , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should be ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life assistance for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ ers home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different than at a real school .
Rio Grande P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS seeks to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Bern@@ ese Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal committee , the elabor@@ ated construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without large discussions .
prior to that , the Board decided , among other things , to apply for an amend@@ ment to a &quot; legal &quot; exception &quot; with respect to &quot; resp@@ ite &quot; exemp@@ tion from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this way we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which is prescribed for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan had no &quot; exceptions &quot; with regard to the inclin@@ ation of the roof - although the town council usually proceeds rather restric@@ tively in the case of liber@@ ating employment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , this is not a recur@@ rent project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step of the process , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be submitted to the Federal Council for the Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the start@@ ling plans of the County Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or of the County Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who will succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; agreed to take over the leadership as of October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
in passing for the next two years , when the Supervisory Board cons@@ ents to the two houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ank , which still has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment has been completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Ar@@ med Forces , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ moving seek@@ ers .
&quot; I &apos;m closing it . &quot; as it goes on with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations .
currently there is a short @-@ term care of Car@@ itas and a day@@ time psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ b@@ ingers of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
although the table leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason to over@@ ride it .
in the past season , the guys in the Bh@@ c took a painful defeat and got something to do there .
hunting accident with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
after firing a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police were established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to violent crimes .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police told Wednesday .
another 20 @-@ year @-@ old , arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be energetic , who was in fact indic@@ ted and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities tried to stop the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ p@@ ses in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .

refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable apartments .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers during the first three months of their stay as asylum seek@@ ers .
many then stum@@ ble across the housing market and joined the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting a housing deficit that will increase from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
for this reason , many people in large cities were living in large cities in the form of flat @-@ room apartments .
young adults remained unbe@@ ar@@ ably longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of their fi@@ del@@ ity in the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has decreased for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance suggests a restart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this context , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
thus , the estate tax could be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended for a limited time .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax @-@ related depreciation options are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee camps at Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the currently available 300 million euros were rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia are setting a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no passing through , as more and more refugees are choosing the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous though .
Croatia seeks to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of Foreign Affairs and if necessary , we will organize a corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Croatian Home Secretary R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the de@@ ple@@ tion of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have broken down to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people had come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reported .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new legislation , which entered into force on the same day , virtually eliminates the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
according to media reports , most of them originate from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter barriers .
the border strip poses other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
after the closure of the border , hardly any refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked .
shortly before the closing of the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws introduce the overcoming and damage of the border area as a crime .
in Sz@@ eg@@ ed , the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
sentences of sentence up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country are threatening the convic@@ ted .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia is a &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself for the purpose of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions from German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing we met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
mayor posted &quot; ro@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday , when ten people suddenly stood at the door of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany surprised the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , Germany ended up in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ e@@ ated the border with two other assistants and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we have only once cal@@ med the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the rail transport to Germany was stopped , but still trying to reach the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on Sunday before a two brid@@ ging run sporting - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent thousands of tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping the establishment of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor has officially moved the position of the Hungarian government into the sphere of national socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to notice that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which she has invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quar@@ ant@@ ine
Konrad has to do all his hands fully with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the First @-@ Recor@@ ding Centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already gained a grip on Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday would be without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations must be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the Länder , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; it goes well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , where it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator has great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot;
on the platform private persons can offer un@@ complicated accommodation .
in addition , we hope for hotels that are empty in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings must observe a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in placing it , Konrad creates with his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for neighbourhood search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected are currently unable to take these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
criticism of the city chief occup@@ ying the distribution of refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday corro@@ bor@@ ated the further action in the question of refugees .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the guards , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for more reinforced solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that now also Austria is introducing controls at its borders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is derived from the German action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ anlagen GmbH is officially completed .
the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is set in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
Euro 1.7 million have been invested in the location by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .

actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la store opposite the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and fabrics from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are starting from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have thought long whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Europe who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I am most interested when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women when looking at a hand@@ bag in rap@@ tures can &apos;t answer the specialist woman with the last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excit@@ ers .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ ally , journalist sh@@ outs or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Pres@@ idency will whi@@ r@@ l up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser &apos;s hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant village is related to it over -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stad@@ l Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter fashion , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a cute documentary about the place and his famous children , including Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher , &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the An@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the story of Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : her desire to return to home in the long run failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , declared a movie start .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the polar , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks more distance to the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so lo@@ cu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which is generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald &apos;s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the Sa@@ gen at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 children , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
the Upper Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was responsible for the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV broad@@ casts including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand@@ still seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , as sunrise reached an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in recent months , Today , the gap to Sunrise has closed .
in August , Today , it reached an average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 took place .
so far in September , sunrise has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe , yiel@@ ded an average of 44@@ 6.000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets Rev@@ e@@ aled ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor is winning .
the woman in which Sam Wood finally landed in The Bachelor was en@@ wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the fin@@ als on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
however , when the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was to receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could their answers become the destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors ?
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ahs ) and Sam@@ i &apos;s energies , I felt they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made it clear last week that wood could be &quot; the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now set up for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who would choose Wood , if not her , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed to Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did to the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of gr@@ ind his ro@@ ok@@ ies to the mill in front of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Hay@@ ne also publicly encouraged Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a punch that was restored in the first game quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just look after the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .

at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sage in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ lad@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get rewards in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free Elec@@ tors conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
in fact , quite different main themes were planned .
but the record number of refugees now also domin@@ ates the Free Elec@@ toral Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will overlay the retreat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ int@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the War of Yugoslavia in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ v@@ inists also called for more staff responsible for asylum lod@@ gings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the leader critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide uniform standards of the Länder . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient . &quot;
but the country politics in large @-@ wall@@ stadt should not fall below the table .
a long lasting success burner continues on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , the Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; a pilot study at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary school of three to four years will be tested .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do so .

4 people killed after police shooting rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shooting rubber bul@@ lets against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district cler@@ k , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station with some of them throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used by which it is known that they can indeed kill , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces which are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ st@@ ened the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court in Kath@@ mandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Alte Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
one is waiting for such offers , that is , the city .
which investor is in question , is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts were concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the buildings on it can be demoli@@ shed .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
the planning for the holiday housing at the Little Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the investor publicly presented plans for the project for the first time .
some of the residents are more worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure facilities
Mon@@ thly , behind closed doors , had been negotiated , gr@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday housing near Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ press company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Council of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and management of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went on the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , called out the images and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea , and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ ch that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics who would increase the traffic by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus charges will have to come , so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ation Camp@@ aig@@ n to collect 11 Million $ for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ stepped the European nations because they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences when she was seven years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally raised funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe has been confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war sh@@ attered Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new J@@ AM@@ A Surgery study .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I above 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes care approximately the same in 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % of the disease was totally free of diabetes and 28 % .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only around two percent .
in addition , the results were found in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the B@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.6 kg ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and showed rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are clu@@ es from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is an issue that is increasingly being noticed in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is delighted that she could put a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the refugees &apos; hom@@ el@@ ands .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama endor@@ sed Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing in their countries is less@@ ened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the United States with@@ drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ times increase of taking of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ ers in children under 12 years reported that po@@ ison@@ ous control centres reported , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children d@@ rank dis@@ infection agent deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among social media .
YouTube videos show how juven@@ ile dis@@ infection agents drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed dis@@ infection products with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent , which are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at K@@ ans@@ as University Hospital , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let go of a si@@ p of whis@@ ky , but people let this hand dis@@ infection in reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes out of straw@@ berry fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was brought into an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold imposed by an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the Medical Center in Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hand dis@@ infection agents outside the child &apos;s reach .
some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
in 2013 two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the twisted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to the school authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
in the event of a rear @-@ end collision between the Nordr@@ ing and Her@@ der , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver has been seriously injured during a rear @-@ up accident .
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ bar in the direction of the industrial area and too late real@@ ises that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ tor and put this vehicle on a Ford Fi@@ esta before it .
in the case of the accident involved vehicles , property damage of about 10,000 euros was caused by the police .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer running and had to be tow@@ ed .

lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I &apos;ll turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic to fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen followed , which is now at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the same - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful during January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as demonstrated by the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) .

in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will see it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship during the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he dies he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die for an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase is persu@@ aded to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , a few meters from a police officer trying to persu@@ ade him to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the C@@ anning V@@ ale police were called on Tuesday for a house peace pit incident in pool ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
Championship soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt tone test at Li@@ dar@@ is which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying accus@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think I &apos;m doing my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy had told the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the Integration Department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they have failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should I think that it will be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and might make people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying let them think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the train@@ ee &apos;s frustr@@ ations have built up with Li@@ dar@@ i &apos;s long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse @-@ deb@@ rief , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my assistants er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
yesterday the whole day could have been like that .
it also had it on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy hits against ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm @-@ Team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not too good in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ athon of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their contact with Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows up again and again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything to our defensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the past six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real centre of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this time is appearing again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling soccer , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the match of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a little exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game &apos;s plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm @-@ Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin on Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit after drug delivery
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long sentence because of his attempt to get in possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ like penalty for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against deposit , under the conditions that he ab@@ oun@@ ds his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident to A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s House breaks apart
in the event of a collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to move to the left in vain , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident causing accident broke completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
a damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone from girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ ler used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg embark@@ ed on the girl &apos;s phone when this fell asleep in an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed the computer found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches that used words for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed that he did it because it would lead to &quot; ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people .
he admitted that searching on the computer was carried out by him , but said that it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and faced the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to be viol@@ ated on 25 January this year and did not appear before court to a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg fails to appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , since one could argue that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was admitted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders even before the date of judgment .
hau@@ lers ev@@ ade small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were increased from fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ aves to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police information , more refugees once again met at Munich central station in comparison with the weekly start on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the south @-@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure zone over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart , Germany .
the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical tree &quot; Henry , &quot; who was dra@@ gged across the Atlantic in recent days from the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the under@@ sea with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again for a longer time .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , there is a lot of momentum going on in the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Audi@@ ence stage 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel is entering the world &apos;s largest competi@@ tor , VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which the first time also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only a five @-@ door Astra .
the second version will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what else will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault transfers the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is available only as five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan install@@ ers want to find their position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti perfectly fits into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 HP .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n pe@@ dest@@ al placed his hand at the front end : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI will be presented at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel judicial authority , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees in principle are entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated into small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
in this way , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : between June and November 2009 he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell comprising around five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s details , was now on his free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his official liability because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Court uph@@ eld the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation are decisive , a compensation claim was given , said it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber Court must now clear the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they first spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple allocation of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had issued an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in the last few weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons had also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
the prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to pun@@ ish@@ ments it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Court of Justice , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young birds , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what to do in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to record a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated sheer determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do it and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Interior ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects . annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments , also refugees will apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to arise and for this the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a common agreement between scientists and the Federal Minister of the Federal Republic of Germany that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany have not been systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
but the integration of refugees is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says migration scientist Dietrich Thr@@ ot@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to Thr@@ ot@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residen@@ cy obligations that limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - the majority of views expressed the majority of views that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster .
a lack of German knowledge is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
up to now , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted by personal contacts .
according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to the kit@@ ties , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only very important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln@@ bar , a narr@@ ator for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin sen@@ ate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more vocational training schools to increase .
in the countries students without knowledge of German will be prepared for lessons in welcome classes .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from the school administration in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , no Bundes@@ land prohibited seek@@ ers of asylum or tolerated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a residence refund or cancellation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start a study .
the latter , in principle , do not receive any B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the justified people .
patient refugees have had to live for four years in Germany so far to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ justified , from 1 January 2016 to shor@@ ten this span to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should succ@@ essively clean up the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions relationship .
it would also be important to establish an islam@@ ic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society will also have to change , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency for a decade and a general equality law .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and for which international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany undertake , must become a reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees hitherto expected , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as regards man@@ power and capacity , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery expects to susp@@ end all the newcom@@ ers in the registration health cards .
services provided could be settled in the federal states later on .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited range of services the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors are above all doing the language barriers .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more inferior to their illnesses than other patients .
they require translation costs not only in clinics , but also in medical practices .
many refugees were also helped with more general medical contact centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ equal disabilities in refugee camps , and the young people deal with HIV .
with the partly different diseases , however , German doctors come from their formation , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the lack of doctors is perhaps even relief from the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they must prove their qualification and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates of the Federal Environment Agency ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs including short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death fear .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have a psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can put an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but it usually takes several months to process .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new &quot; Passion &quot; production , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to captiv@@ ate any age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on a brick is inviting v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ ners .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the family is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family attracts the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to take up loos@@ ely .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .
balancing on a ball with the imp@@ eller ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ies &apos; mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often a topic among various animal welfare organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes of every wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest commandment therefore is to provide good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ tail and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst takes place every day from 17 to 20 September at 5 : 00 pm to his performances .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech that he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in Parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , Head of HP and Chief Executive who will lead unity after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; says the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in the 19@@ 30s to produce electrical installations and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage has been called the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has gone through a massive restructuring to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , which is based on the belief that closely focused businesses provide a better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal crew Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and as far as his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that doesn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ ands in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , which recorded most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil &apos;s circle , but Ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from injury , you have a period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career out of the way he deserves .
Ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players that need it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to move forward by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured on the Richter scale of 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal raised the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not depres@@ sive , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even when in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like an employee of the telephone pastoral care I explained , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m dealing with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous impact , such as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the backdrop to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed cou@@ li@@ sse , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G rent Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G pass by to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park Stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ t as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally getting their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but as they got the points , it was not a classic Fren@@ ch@@ man of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the goal . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents to cause problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which ended on the weekend a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he ended up nicely in the long corner of the network at Johan Wil@@ and .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave herself up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after rest@@ art@@ ing .
nevertheless he proved much more skill in bringing his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria transformed into a shot that was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an Urugu@@ ay@@ an established his sixth seasonal door after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had raised a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi presented a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
the qualification matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago , FC Bayern was shortly before the obligation of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in front of Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid finally won everything , we don &apos;t say anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have me . &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record leader : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has viol@@ ated Guardi@@ ola and I played a great Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with that he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , sh@@ out the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian have soli@@ di@@ fied .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a ne@@ at@@ te that is beaten by her white collar .
the producer of De@@ ar White People advoc@@ ated the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing right to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et has earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when there is an exact ra@@ cial representation in the media at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter had a nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against colour .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album sil@@ ently matter , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ es@@ who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which completed its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant , who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first Ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak up on Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins wasted an opportunity to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp on a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Kis@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two Inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go very focused into the game .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has curved the wood , &quot; said Aus@@ sie .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back at the end of the seventh inner ring , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to strike out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ flow@@ ed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run tear from the righ@@ th@@ and Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen added the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
when Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings Wall , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
at the start of the game Detroit benefited from an even non @-@ mobile Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cut off from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after they first received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter , Hus@@ him gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of success with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers increased in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he didn &apos;t beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before it was replaced by the rel@@ ever righ@@ ty A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder tie , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is stri@@ cken by the vulner@@ ability list to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday

hundreds of refugees to attend Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who came in it should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it calculated with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be accommod@@ ated there temporarily .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government &apos;s pres@@ idency of the government .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed &quot; collective om@@ is@@ sion &quot; to the European states .
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement has passed in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid for refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too has sent back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Security and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people more strongly .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection get it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this view was deeply divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
in the meantime , thousands of desperate refugees are stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest that the border with Romania could also be locked with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence to prevent Hungary from seeking alternative routes across Romania .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants rose to the Greek border in Turkey .

an investigation showed an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury to the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association with .

according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; presumably means four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ on loss . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper with a view to the possible commitment of a non @-@ skilled pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line will often rather be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ gos contain relatively lots of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B @-@ vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support the ey@@ esi@@ ght , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as ch@@ ic@@ cor@@ t and radic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service UPS represents up to 9@@ 5,000 aid for the Christmas business in the United States .
with the recruitment of seasonal workers , the company has already started distributing UPS on Tuesday .

last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 aid .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business .
in 2013 delayed deliveries had brought a harsh criticism to the parcel services .
first fo@@ il@@ storm , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the alpine side of the fo@@ eh@@ n , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows through the fo@@ eh@@ t@@ valleys with storm @-@ strength .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop of temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the alpine side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a consequence , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows in the fo@@ eh@@ t@@ valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance to the adjacent centre of the centre , and on the mountains , even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow at the alpine hill@@ side .
here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening .
in sum it has to be calculated south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with partly over 100 liters of rain per square meter , this has already fallen large amounts of rainf@@ all over the past few days .
on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n enters the air , as a result a cold front with a strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east winds over Switzerland .
along with the cold front , the wind pi@@ cks heavily up to stor@@ my , and temperatures are dropping significantly .
the following days are present in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it is sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on Wednesday in the name of the German Re@@ formers .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located right in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live their faith in hiding as a minority .
with the square , in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a rotten sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him according to histori@@ ans in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the subject of aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the gold @-@ plated crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt drew for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning , the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms gave the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can quite be quite dark .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he made a subj@@ ectively artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
cycles that focus on topics like cross , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land have ar@@ isen .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : the same goes for the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the relevant Scriptures on the basis of his painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus &quot; transl@@ ates &quot; into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who puts his very personal thoughts on the particular situation here .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant ruler of the Sovereign Order of Malta .
&quot; the education took place already with the cane , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to re@@ vise this , to perhaps also forgive me with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising today , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced here .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the pictures , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday presenting the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; always a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
old did not pay attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but the most important , also mysterious subjects selected for him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and linen wallpaper - is presented for the first time in an exhibition that opens on November 15 in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans made , place found , company commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ elled for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn , it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration caused land@@ ings , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the First Common Ad@@ visor Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been able to communicate with the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then start with the work at the former indoor swimming pool without another pause .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ lig@@ a sets a clear mark on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the pending problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nothing beats me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State Mr@@ s Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the Chancellor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can help and wants to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the crucial course must be politics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals place a clear sign when on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ar , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) , they will contribute to the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s manager Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee tragedy goes on everyone , nobody can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can use our beam , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had started their own projects in their locations is great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association together with the German Federal Government &apos;s DF@@ B and the Federal Government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Chairman of the Board of Management loses one eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the chief executive of Europe &apos;s biggest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he dropped out to a water glass he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he is almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out of the street - this he told us last week , &quot; cited the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company .
&quot; I &apos;m busy for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren Sp@@ are pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
it therefore comes as little as a reserve driver for the two Stam@@ b@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just as little as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : turn@@ table in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us have definitely broken up in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19@@ .00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; league against Le@@ verk@@ usen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to practice on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high load on its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change in the position of the gate keeper .
for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of regular @-@ master Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open for Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller to be used in all Europa League games .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ mic statement by fellow players Re@@ us , that the final draw for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance of taking the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in driving cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the IAA in a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communications .
a test track is currently being tested on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany , for example , wants to use internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged people as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wait far to 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD @-@ traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute , concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it to be 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed by 20@@ 25 expect autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
following a survey by the Bit@@ kom digital network , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire drive on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least be 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says Team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status of the title battle of September 25 to October 4 , Düsseldorf plans to kick @-@ off only in single .
the final decision is to be made latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship .
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight for a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded us of the European Championships 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; at that time Timo lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was ble@@ ak before , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been done in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give you an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work , for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers took 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival , there was still a special highlight : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion studies of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him to play .
he later taught fashion designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery @-@ machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers who worked on them for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ gran@@ ites P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion plays a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , was then replaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names several examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasingly competitive potential .
those who don &apos;t need a niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer in the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
fashion j@@ okes P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace and embroi@@ dery industry association together with nine other companies .
only they may wear the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialty shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
nowadays , the bulk ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is distributed almost exclusively through chains .
furthermore , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension field between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
at some points the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little chi@@ cks .
the P@@ lau@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed master in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends should not be touched , but Disney still dar@@ es to take a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about re @-@ screening , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes 20 years after the first film with the magic child girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in the times of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws are still unclear .
but the director already says : Ro@@ b Marshall , recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI aims to open the economy broad@@ ly for the world
the economy needs to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform .
&quot; China should commit to attracting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
after the statement a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important since it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a rule of law and more open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease checks on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and thereby provide consumers with a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who received a corresponding paper from the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be increased from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already so heavily bur@@ dened with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ voc@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are often so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ elden is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily corro@@ ded by the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ tioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low volumes are particularly likely to cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry stated on his homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury occurs primarily through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written confirmation by the Federal Ministry for the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants dischar@@ ged more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
