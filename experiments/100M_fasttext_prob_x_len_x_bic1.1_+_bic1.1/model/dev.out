Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s continuing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will during the peace process .
through the deal adverti@@ sed by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme , the relationship between the two has continued to deterior@@ ate .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial talk , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech had not been agreed with Obama , a meeting had declined this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
in an emergency call , Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog , &quot; but still alive and probably upset , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
within the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled to a white block : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb did the fatal cry at some point after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were happy about his teaching .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty encompasses 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the University &apos;s employment policy meant that the doctorate for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not represent an automatic path to an appointment as assistant professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house but Johnson said that he believes he knew the people who lived there .
lamb was growing up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he completed his doctorate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the many years of friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a spher@@ ical audience .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program and specialized in American Indi@@ genous peoples and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the college of students .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended a candle light memorial at the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the remin@@ ders , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebec@@ ca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now telling that Lamb opened the emergency call after he shot himself and that Lamb in his distress call Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we were sitting in the theater waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and a knife @-@ length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cin@@ emas in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict that lasts almost five years , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ise that at this time , in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which none of them also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to pl@@ unge him .
here are some recent survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of ten say they were &quot; angry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for its bom@@ b@@ astic and offen@@ ding statements , 52 percent of the Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , according to ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is valid in the first country of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
yet 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively execute his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their money hats , republi@@ can voters hold tr@@ ump for real ones .
if they are asked who best wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten at the end of July put their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against just 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
however , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P voters consider Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gather around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump @-@ support is scattered over more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by the Mon@@ mouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is harvesting the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally in front of Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ in @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says they have formed their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have committed their votes firmly .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as often for Tr@@ ump .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans are saying that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; two months ago , immigration became a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump vital His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post survey of Monday six out of ten Republi@@ cans are saying that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the in@@ filtration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do it too .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new heights .
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for roughly half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of ten Republi@@ cans are saying in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are angry at Washington too .
a pol@@ l from Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated about the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ fer@@ nal . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ok@@ ie trail is the most expensive housing complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , one square meter of a shed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro .
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; says the study - that is , the high price .
a new study shows in which specific areas a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well noticed .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria dream start thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
dou@@ bly scor@@ cher in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola &apos;s team won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es scored ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to fetch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28th consecutive hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership paid by Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who had to pass a bul@@ ky shot of the World Champion .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans of hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich talked about it .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without sh@@ aming .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his latest six home games in the top class , including prestigious clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , in seven European up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too inno@@ cent@@ ly in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by the shift of the game on the left @-@ hand side of Douglas Costa , which rarely went through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right , when his flan@@ k turned from the right half @-@ field in the left upper tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
the best times in the first half of the year were Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first of all , when Olympic @-@ stri@@ ker @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown struck the Polish head ball ( 26 ) .
then by direct removal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians w@@ rest@@ led their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set up con@@ i@@ fers .
on keeper Manuel Neu@@ er , however , he was reli@@ eved .
so , for instance , when he drew a shot from the idea to the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er guar@@ dians made a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup Her@@ o had given the green light only after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59 . ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller used one of them .
in front of the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
after a smaller group of partly m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block provoked the followers of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich @-@ based supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in case of aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk is reduced rapidly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.6 to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
root causes of tooth decay are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress .
the connection between smoking and the loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , writing the researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smokers , first author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , explained study leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health up to the age of old according to our findings .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 @-@ 74 years of tooth@@ lessness affected the DI@@ f@@ E .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking lowers the risk of early dental failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
archae@@ ologists come across from Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ n@@ ants of the L@@ ate Anti@@ quity
archaeological findings have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , Museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a specialist office for archaeological site preservation .
in the third phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found their findings .
Trier was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves that probably belonged to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the railway station in ho@@ stages , the Federal Police asks the people to help .
on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 am the woman crosses the railway station at the end of the railway station and was captured by a freight train coming from the direction of Mön@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , it was severely injured by the capture of the train .
she was treated in emergency and brought to hospital by emergency services .
on the basis of the ni@@ gh@@ tly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the investigating magi@@ strates .
the incident may have been witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
local residents or p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by come from Lin@@ der@@ ner Railway , Ziegel@@ aker Trail , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .
information on the cause of the accident can be provided by telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police service office under telephone 0@@ 800 / 6@@ 88@@ 8000 or any other police station .
European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to hei@@ gh@@ ten the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the TT@@ IP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Court of App@@ eal .
they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
a second instance is planned for the first time .
it would allow it to ex@@ alt obj@@ ections .
so far , the parties involved agreed among themselves to arbit@@ rators , there was no claim against their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent months debate , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , according to his own data , she wants to work towards an international investment judgment .
there could , for instance , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is required above all by large corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice that allows companies to set damages on the tax@@ pay@@ ers , break national laws , or en@@ force a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the criticism was , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German economic secretary , Matthias Mach@@ ining ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into consideration fundamental points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the legal possibilities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged in this way .
the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement were still unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
so far , however , the subject of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
originally , a framework for the agreement was supposed to stand at the end of this year .
this date is deemed to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage in the Prime Club of Cologne ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the in@@ timi@@ dating fol@@ ks@@ y recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells the story of various places he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ti@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they came from and what it looks like in his homeland .
since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Iris@@ h@@ man .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; there are clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late 60s , but can effort@@ lessly master opul@@ ent music at any time .
it is rum@@ oured that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be sung in a row .
but already 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on expectations .
in this case , St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a nationwide masterpiece is published in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any ann@@ u@@ ity list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively .
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
from the smaller clubs long ago , the stage shows become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in a dark Ham@@ bur@@ gers More !
he mainly presents the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; available since March .
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk .
without saying a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
from the audience one hears : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and it is possible to put the &quot; record in the bottom . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed St@@ ev@@ ens for an en@@ core , plays an acoustic few older songs and finally succ@@ um@@ bs to thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister Fra@@ gran@@ ce
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s ques@@ tioning will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is expected to make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and for the first time with David Cameron . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to put the first of his six pre @-@ appointed questions shortly after mid@@ day , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs close by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he called for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this weekly event . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also said that he could skip some meetings to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain was provoked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several Tit@@ els@@ grund stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n speaker said he had been &quot; in dis@@ respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , spoke in the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are called on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
BBC Robin Bran@@ t &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also &quot; stack@@ ed within Labour , &quot; according Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statement on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes should be made to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and retired minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch @-@ Box during the last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , says he had &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr Cameron &apos;s questions and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ings are too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the quar@@ rel with bar@@ bed hooks and instead focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , who will represent the shadow of economic prime minister , if he does not take part - for example , when Mr Cameron is abroad .
he also talked about the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of Comm@@ ons , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester &apos;s theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the Fra@@ gran@@ ce was considered as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position among his colleagues , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and require far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increase through accelerated earnings growth in the United Kingdom
in parallel with this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller policy objective .
between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and has made estimates of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of the rival AB In@@ be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
according to encouraging news , Bur@@ berry treas@@ ury shares were higher than 0.@@ 9 % higher than the competition group for luxury goods .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core &apos;s shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had $ 2.5 billion by selling a stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the Mon@@ di packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had sold his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports gear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs at his company , he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on Bie@@ ber &apos;s expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .
twenty @-@ one years young , a hand@@ ing with a super@@ sti@@ cker f@@ law .
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more and more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 am , however , the pol@@ ka sits on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Ben@@ ding of Ben@@ ding : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite , in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mother E@@ wa ear@@ ns half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Vik@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade at high school . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot;
school attendance ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans do not .
even Bie@@ ber himself does not .
he has taken care of it anyway .
for the advertising in the advertising break of the Super@@ du , he cas@@ hed three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company washed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects himself .
if Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you &apos;ll be amazed at the window .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say that the hyp@@ e g@@ ossi@@ p too far .
others stress that , after all , Bie@@ ber is currently ranked # 1 with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot;
Ben@@ ding himself , whose fourth album should follow in November , is not really interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and indeed in the Pot@@ ato d@@ öner , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
inspired by the phrase &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat inserted together on a sk@@ ewer .
the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the wording &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; he had seen in television by chance .
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea was to let the Leban@@ ese register at the Patent Office in Munich .
it has recently been protected as utility model according to the authority .
for this reason Al@@ hay is not willing to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes are in the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash starts campaig@@ ning campaign to combat algae collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a floor@@ standing campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ manufactur@@ er@@ S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian football league to loyal customers .
Met@@ cash is expected to disclose further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day .
there is much stake in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores account for and generate higher profit margins as a met@@ cas@@ h@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers disp@@ ose of a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern Australia .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will cut around five per cent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this predic@@ tion is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
Mr K@@ ier@@ a said Mr K@@ ier@@ a said : the loss in the food and food business and in the volumes on metal cas@@ h@@ s of high fixed costs could cost around 13 million $ gain before interest and tax .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably would disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the Board of Directors of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s food and food trade , providing about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction in terms of sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to settle sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA retailers to improve their stores by fast growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ cas@@ h@@ s Managing Director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop @-@ remedi@@ ation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gios and deserves praise for his own conduct in the opinion of President of Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious argument with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison having to beat K@@ yr@@ gios , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp rebu@@ ked a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is von He@@ aly was stead@@ fast@@ ly defended .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious of is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said .
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi highly enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he adapts to the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision that starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick has quickly made the rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to explain to him the consequences of his actions . some time out of the ramp in which he can only think about it , I think it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , stops refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those trying to enter the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants arrived in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people who had fled before violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
as a police helicopter ho@@ vering above them , the migrants sc@@ ared up &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police .
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations blo@@ c at a deb@@ atable meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the tor@@ tured Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state of emergency that was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison mates were employed in the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government decre@@ ed along the southern border to Serbia for a crime . these laws also specify greater sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; said Mr. Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ ac &apos;s repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but reports from Associated Press have already seen on the border heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , State Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by har@@ ming the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly rep@@ airing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounding the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate people &apos;s data and press a crowd to get into it .
about 20 managed to get involved , but thousands ab@@ ode outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they arrive in Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders hal@@ ved in national pol@@ l
former U.S. Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is continuing to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders gains ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is running for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say their opinions are determining what candidates they will support .
but Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates in their election .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored some gains .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections were reduced .
their support for the men has declined mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders just returned with 5 points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clin@@ ically &apos;s advantage in democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Clinton has a big advantage over older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries nationwide say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are enthusiastic about it most of all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top channel Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consent to dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the vice @-@ president proposes a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although one @-@ third believes that he should not do so .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head .
more than half of Clin@@ tons &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den , not candidates for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , will increase H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead to S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bi@@ den is by far a second with this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; selectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors has emerged as unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates have good results in some of the important characteristics of voters in the prim@@ aries of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
among the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 per cent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him .
in general , democratic voters of the prim@@ aries see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being made during ten@@ ure as foreign minister , most Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said the email contro@@ versy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse .
there are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views from Clinton become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them amongst registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 per cent of the eligible voters do not see Tr@@ ump as honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks for guidance .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new pol@@ l is no longer required for the two candidates , and others lose their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue supporting nationwide hop@@ per in large numbers . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted prior to Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the survey from Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fired at the same time from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demo@@ graphics groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump amongst Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated by Wis@@ cons@@ ze Scott Walker , who fell the lowest , with 10 % support in the last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former governor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are 6 % on the third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in surveys - with 19 % support from Republi@@ cans , behind the pump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also showed a lot of tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son , rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ thi@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find still warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
by contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach a temperature of up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bor@@ ns
almost two years after a student died during a deport@@ ation of a student in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said he was loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood didn &apos;t call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to catch up advice , said Police Chief Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members began to hide implements and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning in his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeated with bl@@ unt force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year at the har@@ ass@@ lands , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family , in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended charges of murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with a criminal attack and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also bring this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rate of interest comes , and the hous@@ et@@ se will be shaken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guide to the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
hence , representatives of the central bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end of the market , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still to a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a view based on historical trends as to how some sectors of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; there seems to be a tendency for assets margins to be cancelled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which may once again reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on after interest increases in the F@@ ed .
more precisely , in the past 35 years , the market is relatively flat in the upward trend - about 14 percent after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal after 500 days , with an average return in past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a current analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , head plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return on investment begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice nominal GDP of less than 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlan@@ ta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all year round , market participants were prepared for a interest increase in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC may appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading assumes only a 25 percent chance .
&quot; in our study , all the development cycles of 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists were put into the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; said the report .
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest increase , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic course .
in the case of loans , yields seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the Elev@@ ation cycle , the bond@@ men fall immediately , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to greater conver@@ gence between longer and shorter loans and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
highly @-@ interest bonds often yield better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , Jones says that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , bor@@ rowing has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy .
in large and large companies that handle the greater part of their business activities in the United States will benefit if interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debt will become worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market and also finance their debt .
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers .
companies with a strong balance sheet achieved an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the majority , said Gold@@ man .
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside of the pure share games .
savers could see gains through higher income , even if experts are of different opinion how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atives critici@@ zed the channel because of its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly difficult to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked the Voice and said this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; to Classic FM , &quot; states a leading member of parliament and puts new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private transm@@ it@@ ters do not .
the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC boss that the public @-@ legal radio station was &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer distingu@@ ish@@ able from his commercial competitors .
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples in which you only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC Director General re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I won &apos;t get to know anything about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er efforts must be made to engage the audience when it did this in the past , because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which was under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory member Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sts that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Richter - was produced &quot; in special BBC mode . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it &apos;s the next time a series of entertainment is star@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to issue the order of further series of The Voice in the future , or to give money to revenue t@@ ear@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he stated that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may see that growth is less@@ ened .
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites fell off .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop purch@@ as@@ ers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium saw that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of the purchases are now being carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online , rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane crash killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia lays down the collapse of some of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee .
mour@@ ning @-@ filled , largely dressed in white , the distance to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession passed over to the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane had fallen through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the cor@@ p@@ ses were approved for the funeral when the Saudi king ordered a sanc@@ tion over the Bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 people who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed by the Great Central mo@@ b of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi @-@ officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to become the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said that the bin Laden could not stop the arm of the crane when he was not in use .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency affir@@ med that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was forbidden abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised what caused the fall of the Cran@@ s , who pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner court yard where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch meeting later this month .
the Bin Laden Group has published no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also led the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ sh@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi Arabia &apos;s family for decades and is taking over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was kidn@@ apped by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people remain in hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap Eastern European tra@@ des@@ men is over
Brit@@ ons increasingly employ craftsmen , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe has increased
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets throughout the country
von Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Head Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out the work in their home .
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
because Brit@@ ons increasingly employ tra@@ des@@ people to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the chain of construction markets , said that a large increase in the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , as eight out of ten purchase decisions are taken by women .
at the moment the men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we must shift this more strongly to a balance .
in principle , half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK leader listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also outlined her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group bl@@ amed the cost of closing the shops .
due to the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball court master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and sever@@ ance of duties on Wednesday .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also indic@@ ted for abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted from this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney General , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary examination that the accused were used for private purposes in 2006 @-@ 2011 , funds from the association &apos;s accounts , which allowed them to disp@@ ose in their functions .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also charged with financial losses .
this fact was eliminated by the Chair@@ person of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the defence presented itself to the rejection of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity that an asset was not incurred to the association at any time .
the sports officials had charged only expense allowance and the sports club for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 and where they had invested a lot of time and money out of the debt - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) in 2001 .
&quot; back then , we stood before the situation : do we continue the club or lock it ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the B@@ read @-@ Occup@@ ation of the Financial Office .
with his colleague and co @-@ accused , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , our life insurance policies were put down as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , it is not allowed to make any debts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a corresponding financial success , the payment of compensation claims has been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
as a result , l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed deviations appeared , the former ob@@ servant explained the procedures .
the two def@@ end@@ ants attacked the accounts and as@@ par@@ ted books and said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why the pay@@ outs have not been disclosed in detail to the association asked the judge . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for the funding , it was important that the debt was free , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one of the officials began investigations because of abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account was due to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said that he thought that this was the best for the club .
if something happened to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
this transfer was formulated as a &quot; claim return . &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and public prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any harm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never related a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
he charged the association € 1,000 per month for di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the accused could not provide accurate documents for the early years .
they were no longer stored after an audit in which everything had been assessed correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the shifts were made in cash , so he had to go to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff reduction that has been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ stub@@ ese will reduce further jobs when spl@@ itting the enterprise .
there is no end to the inter@@ missions with the US Compu@@ te Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( EUR 2.4 billion ) are to be saved , and the company announced on Tuesday .
the move will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP still employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett Packard share went up to 2.3 percent in the after@@ market .

sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets from traditional computers and getting more and more shopping online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water @-@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred deployed refugees on the Serbian border .
Eur@@ on@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police , a police line had formed and a water @-@ beam was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials were initially un@@ interrup@@ t@@ edly inhal@@ ing pep@@ per@@ mint .
after that the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now rec@@ ited somewhat cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .

time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historic event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has been based on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank possibly leaves the zero sector and starts a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the indications point out that the odds against such a step are good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 08.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death row at the Delta State University left excuse
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen &quot; said authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science at Delta State University , called the emergency telephone number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot at someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb was told the staff of the emergency department that the police must send police officers back to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; and he also mentioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when police officers surround him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; University president William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they were married about seven years ago as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 and she &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , which was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police said Lamb had ph@@ oned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will not go to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , escaped on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doctorate degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace for Group restructuring .
meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the trade union .
Lufthansa construc@@ ts its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate earnings contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa will not have a board of directors for passenger operations in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the Executive Board of Chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings .
with the new positioning , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double fac@@ ture of his right leg at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven &apos;s champion League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playground and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be published tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the dressing room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to be able to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an el@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat of PS@@ V

when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you then hear it is a very serious injury , this is not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be .
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m so sorry about it .

all nice and well except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , returns instead a summary of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . &quot; a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious : the text presented by Cameron is partly read like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so much familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears , how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees @-@ prone , Th@@ need kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler despite the protests of the nam@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ vering , sn@@ ug creature that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax a child 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral district office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ oon &apos;s employees , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ ons was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to b@@ ump into Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ side .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks &apos;s site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry fo@@ ols of 2012 , only a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball , Mo@@ dena is developing as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size on the test layer , is an option for the attack .
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th turns out from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to skip Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ ons would have been extended , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully if he kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even though he did not perform such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test guy gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ ons got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick comp@@ ton got nine .
only comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and down@@ play .
the only accus@@ ation that can be raised was that England first set up Jonathan despite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ ons was in top form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent bridge , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting mos@@ ques in addition to Cook , which would give an extra spin punch and receive four Qui@@ cks , di@@ ved up , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ dena perhaps did not do his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he joined Open@@ er in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ re as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his statistics on - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no big number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coach .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , which will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air even if the messages are consistent with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ey &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not employed at the one @-@ day@@ makers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some won &apos;t agree , but coaches and team leaders do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made with light hearts .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy is entering a sl@@ ack until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ developed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the ingeni@@ ous Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which viol@@ ently viol@@ ated Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , as the EU is now , and not always on their own guilt , Britain &apos;s own agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local variables , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , looking for outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , cau@@ tious , is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened during the over@@ drive long outs like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French President François Hollande is looking forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will break down one leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful notes , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; Britain has gained nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press zone , as they were not during the 1975 referendum held by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they cannot recall Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts , who made a name for themselves as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone @-@ shaking foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that if you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you &apos;d better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters who opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me anymore - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks &apos; boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , an error at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ se@@ ater he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it kindly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ aut@@ é tendency and the wild cor@@ rid@@ ors of Toronto &apos;s Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ismus may well say Yes .
it is what Hil@@ ary said , &quot; Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week when the boy sc@@ ou@@ ting fought in him not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate vis @-@ à @-@ vis his Labour Cab@@ inet mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay &quot; under all circumstances - B@@ enny &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their Sunday evening .
whatever the cur@@ ving bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline will remain important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like this .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite economic economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic stri@@ fe .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be required to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital , - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can all be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already rather disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , whereby I was reminded of something at the start on Monday , which was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking was originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined L@@ anc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health UK ( P@@ he ) in its report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic Report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and described it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal L@@ anc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; at which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 individuals who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to bring their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ based products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing directors were previously reported by British American Tob@@ acco Retail ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for selecting the members of the committee are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco line from P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the Group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage most of the products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these connections or restrictions is discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s alleg@@ ations have already been re@@ acted before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are small compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison with tobacco .
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC to quit East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time with Channel 4 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , which I do not consider medium or long term to be a good idea , you should at least put your production to programs that others don &apos;t do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funded , which could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ enders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would have to see how this should be public television . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular shows again give what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , proposed in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ enders to sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can rather not measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions for the justification of € 4 billion broad@@ cast@@ ers , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they lay them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , all of us think that there is a great value here for £ 150 per year , but for people who have a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their ethics mission , to &quot; inform , educ@@ ate and to enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it is 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening , and convers@@ ing with the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships El@@ stein said , the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial transm@@ it@@ ters Alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells by means of sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms revealed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ azi@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the depths brain stimulation , an invasive procedure providing electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves appear on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , thus a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when ultras@@ onic applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mo@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neur@@ ons with light impulses .
but Cal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired position in the brain on an optical fiber , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and metro trains , requiring a second look .
&quot; important Noti@@ fication : drive from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the fonts of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .

the 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum for cruel designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ aland .
a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group helped distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ &quot; pack of Allen keys , &quot; claimed to gain access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ o@@ dy displays produced by special Pat@@ rol Group .
according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists will get more critical and try to bring political works to the public outside galleries .
many artists engage with activists within protest movements and notice that they must move outside into the real world , so that their art has an impact on society .
another of the anti @-@ weapons trade posters will greet commuters in the underground .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works char@@ itable with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over @-@ artist , who works for free as well .
V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the trade fair - through a legend of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
they played with the invention of a more realistic shad@@ y company advertising , but &quot; by means of bright colours and animation , it remains firm . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture instruments at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is a stri@@ de of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not being tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative art around the trade fair dates back to the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors are f@@ ading fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be di@@ sti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely horri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to say : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken a Sabbath year , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are honest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ ited and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people go .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and communal Hang@@ outs , but they are also places where people dress and wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not remember to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um@@ mel culture that can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away in order to get the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking on .
apro@@ pos do@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my residence halls had the idea that an in@@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship conclu@@ des with baking .
as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I &apos;ve made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to chat and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are an an@@ alog@@ ous b@@ aker .
poorly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat cause people to sleep when you get kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the cla@@ ws of chi@@ ckens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you are among the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbours if there was something for them to make Drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut down her door and went to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move into the same student residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be utterly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , ran@@ som them , get rid of them , and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they draw all together friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot fellow dw@@ eller is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your lower abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his not locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
teach by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your property more than twice at the ceiling .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single mothers , pick@@ pockets
real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert is building terra@@ ced houses in central Fran@@ con@@ ia for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living room , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the poor servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build even today cheap and good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushed to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ bert believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Markus Gil@@ bert : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mass accommodation in containers or gymn@@ as@@ tics has no sustainability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the people remain a great part here .
in light of the flow of refugees we need enough living space in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
guil@@ ds : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of residence .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a lounge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
guil@@ ds : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ bert : I have successfully passed my project .
it is especially complicated to make the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the parking ordin@@ ance regulation .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
it is still under@@ estimated who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did local residents react to their terra@@ ced building project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which definitely is not true .
but don &apos;t you shar@@ pen the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the past five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not only refugees , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the poor servant .
I show you how to build even today cheap and good .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , tap &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush returns or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made this more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a dedicated tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worthwhile to ensure that your cell phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , since the phone may switch off half@@ way and lead to an interruption of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s Only Dev@@ ise : full Attack
in the fight for the World Cup title N@@ ico Ros@@ berg , in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed in front of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and will also launch the Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
it is still unclear whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore .
for days , a ha@@ ze &apos;s bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
the Chess Club in Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the membership number increased to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who kept in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1 . class and honorary citizen of the cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the Schach@@ club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by Chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who do not have the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of its connection with the spa town .
district office seeking direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the old people &apos;s centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have worked together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg place .
in addition to consultations you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation draws it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ing information on questions such as the nursing insurance or services of the health and nursing homes .
for years , with our ambul@@ atory care service , we have been committed to ensuring that often car@@ egi@@ vers are left alone .
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; not in@@ frequently many benefits of till@@ ers are not used , because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as well as for the Amb@@ ul@@ atory Service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis .
both managers see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre , especially in demographic change .
this is because it constitutes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the lon@@ el@@ iness in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a great contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and as good as possible in their familiar environment .
the accommodation office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

men beating on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point , the group was at the height of the b@@ ft service station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young man and struck him with his f@@ ist .
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ l and ble@@ ed strongly out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a car up to the apartment and drove past several times .
when one didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a head@@ stock , one examined the face and thi@@ ghs of the victim .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue item description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second rac@@ quet was about 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and advis@@ ors to contact the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes care of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen .
furthermore , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of field breaks on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on hand in the next few months .
after a conversion phase , Müller opens the practice on 12th October , until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises on St. Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 .
it was a sympathy at first sight when the field @-@ standing figure was met with Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ z@@ l , who is currently completing her medical education at the Ver@@ den hospital and wants to go into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ lers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ enh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it was ready I just called it . &quot;
the idea was to the couple Müller in future to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clos@@ eness and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families through the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so one was agreed that the land@@ fills bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , followed by his medical studies in Hanover , followed by several doctor &apos;s offices and in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a general practitioner in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior physician in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and is engaged in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the practice for the new boss will be prepared from September 19 .
while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gh@@ ausen is working as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Internal Medicine ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the tr@@ ash , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ z@@ l .
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
the mil@@ ler will receive a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 euros as part of a funding programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Deputy Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come into practice every quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another house doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practice of practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy still remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ halt .
if no successor found himself , she would have gone .
anyone who visits Müller &apos;s consultations will continue to look forward to familiar faces : the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms will take over .
with their par@@ ting , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows rec@@ alls smiling .
after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will be able to see many patients for sure , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin .
her husband compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always been pressed against gar@@ dening , now it could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border checks are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that anyone who wants asylum application can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to travel to Austria and Germany and possibly also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see this very much in Lai@@ bach though .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia , rather , will intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , on the other hand , strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees but not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government ha@@ st@@ ened , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to travel past T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid registration .
the Croatian police could attack them in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly meeting police cars with new refugees .
it is primarily about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days , his country will reck@@ on with some 4,000 refugees , said R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , Minister of the Interior .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which have so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t direction to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was for people to adopt certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the in@@ mates were on the way through Serbia all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west route .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for details he did not call him , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we conduct strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 . since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good report concerning the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees are now wanting to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
Wednesday morning , the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down the debate on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed forever .
it would not take a long time to deal with very high numbers of refugees .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees already started distributing maps on which alternative routes across Croatia are drawn .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchange h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , accused of having provided insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the collected information , inside stores should have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are ultimately caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the processes against 32 other accused were perpet@@ rated in this case .
most of the def@@ end@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpet@@ rators are said to have acted both in the USA and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
the operation takes place around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
people do their worries , partly fast steps , partly comfortably stroll .
they ste@@ er the two stops of the Mannheim car park at the par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , pr@@ all life with glorious autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four big boards each with the heading &quot; Before I dying I want .... &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence with this action and is quite faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and talks like the volunteers .
while some one fits spontaneously to the chal@@ k and &quot; read &quot; the sentence &quot; my life affir@@ med &quot; &quot; can &quot; read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; suffer not long &quot; , others remain short , read , say phrases as &quot; as far I am not yet &quot; and go on .
again and again small discussions develop on the edge of the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end comes to this world , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work of Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas Association of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid .
therefore , this public effective action to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .
the fact that everyone does not want to express himself publicly on the boards is understandable , but finally it is a very personal matter .
the subject of death and death continues to be afflicted with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up people .
an app@@ rais@@ al shared by An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral and mour@@ ning companion is one of the volunteer workers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was sum@@ mon@@ ed by the Hon@@ orary President , she immediately informed herself and was there at the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and relatives are accompanied in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
all of them are carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her tasks and experiences and experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the ambul@@ ant ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as further education and supervision of the funeral and mour@@ ning companion .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Res@@ ult mixed , Financial outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its land transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre@@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. claimed to earn a profit from $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected , according to a fac@@ t@@ set survey of 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower outlook , despite the price increases , is 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4th , despite higher elev@@ ations for heavy and large packages rising from November .
the company said that it was nevertheless expected that the result would increase in comparison with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and because of growth in the online trade .
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; solid yields can be achieved by taking into account weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS , who plans to employ 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , which predicted 12 analysts from Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales rose by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s surv@@ eyed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has witnessed a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 per cent , but operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while the result decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the pre@@ market trading , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days a week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening over them at one end of the decorated two @-@ storey meeting hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the map is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a double mission from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the near @-@ zero interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it just one quarter of the percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they can observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself insur@@ es the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed raises the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that a further increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other experts argued that a rate increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed well to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the sentence was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases showed signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
the economy &quot; can tackle higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics .
but financial markets all over the world collap@@ sed at the end of last month after China rep@@ lic@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would cho@@ ke global growth .
the market has recovered somewhat this month , and the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the last few weeks , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liners , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not the main concern of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be considered technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere indication of the former leader , Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow down its monetary expansion , &quot; triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for Asset Management at En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
in 1998 / 1999 , Lack@@ er , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ated a interest increase , cited decisions as an example in the years 1998 / 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia prompted the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited noticeable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market share , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Inter@@ est Rate of the Bank of England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to that level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she fears an increase in interest because markets are exciting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should ha@@ sten the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life assistance for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of countless volunteers .
in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da too , there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she is still teaching with her 74 sequences .
every Thursday , she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , this is quite different from a real school .
Rio Grande P@@ edi@@ at@@ ric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization S@@ PC tries to educ@@ ate women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies that su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese gymn@@ asi@@ um
the municipality of Bern@@ ried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar panels .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Centre is progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent joint session , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without great discussions .
before that , the Board decided , among other things , to apply for a structural &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; resp@@ ecting &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the current development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be constructed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this way we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
in the &quot; liberation &quot; it was again about the roof inclin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be less than ten degrees .
as a result , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof inclin@@ ation does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; - although Bern@@ rie@@ der Gemein@@ deb@@ auch tends to be more restric@@ tive as a rule in the case of deliver@@ ance orders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
costs are estimated at 2.3 million euros .
sur@@ pl@@ uses are expected from school and l@@ ati@@ tudes .
in the next step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter large hall will now be presented to the Federal Council for the Ex@@ am@@ ination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the start@@ ling plans of the County Co@@ unc@@ ill@@ or , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , the Supervisory Board will decide on the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would continue working at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
in Wei@@ l@@ heim , employees who do not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been Medical Director of Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital since the beginning of the year and is now switching to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
on the question of who should succeed , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the leadership as of October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
for the next two years , when the Supervisory Board cons@@ ents to the approval of both houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ank , which still has 35 beds , is to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 if the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , counter@@ ed rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal squ@@ ad , is to be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future .
&quot; I conclude this . &quot; as I continue with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß was not able to say that there are several considerations .
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there has not been a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a senior physician for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure over the past few decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand@@ ball of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions is required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
although the Table leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason to over@@ ride .
in the past season , the guys from the Bh@@ c took a painful defeat and got something to do there .
hunting accident with two wounded near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
after a firing a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the crime police investigated .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a crime suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted to have killed the young people and thrown their bodies into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday , fell victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police told Wednesday .
another 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , is regarded as suspect and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived at home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people there was finally a crime suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found .
according to the authorities , the authorities tried to stop the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the dead bodies in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the Haf@@ e@@ chter on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigation is to shed light on the circum@@ stance of the facts .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable place to stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
with the coming refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are completed in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first @-@ class accommodation .
many then stum@@ ble across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compl@@ ains Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of accommodation in the WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of their fi@@ del@@ ity in the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should boost social housing development .
thus , the real estate tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is suspended for a limited period .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee camps by the state bank Kf@@ W is now well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million had already been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free travel : Croatia and Slovenia are setting a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is practically no more transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia seeks to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organize a corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and already belongs to the Schengen zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the de@@ position of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day also virtually eliminate the proper asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic explained : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police took up the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
most of the tribal reports originate from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter barriers .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 people attacked .
just before the closing of the gate on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws introduce the overcoming and damage of the border area as a criminal off@@ ence .
in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated .
the convic@@ ted criminal sentences up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants were 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
practically nobody has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left at the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
barrier screens were min@@ ed and one of the recording camps in the border town was rebuilt .
no one wanted to comment on the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants still remained in the country according to government figures .
in Salzburg around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by instructions from German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly on foot .
mayor posted &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy on Sunday after the bridge festival , when suddenly ten people stood at the door of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but because of the refugee flow , it ended up in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ ated the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we have only once cal@@ med the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we take it by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler in O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very happy , &quot; Stad@@ ler .
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers climbed from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u , after the announcement that the rail transport to Germany was stopped , but still trying to reach the border .
the regional train was turned off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
together with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , the Brück@@ en@@ fest joined the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday - organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping at the helm of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the construction of structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has officially and openly embra@@ ced the position of the Hungarian government in the sphere of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only the Austri@@ ans , who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge , given the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , to create decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try quarters
Konrad has to do all his hands with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place lod@@ gings for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos at the first reception centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Con@@ rad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no homeless shel@@ ters in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , said Konrad and praised the &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the Länder , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already led conversations with the provincial govern@@ ors .
these would have assured him that they will also create lod@@ gings for the coming refugees .
&quot; it goes well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ate supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
the asylum co @-@ ordin@@ ator has great expectations in the ORF event &quot; Hel@@ ping as we do . &quot;
on the platform private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , we hope for hotels that are vac@@ ant in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that lod@@ gings must comply with a certain amount of towel holder or height of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad is based on his experience . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , who is not telling the truth without further ado .
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs of the Republic as they declared themselves .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own search for districts hasn &apos;t been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons affected can currently be prevented without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of an emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suitability .
the chief of the city is critici@@ zing the distribution of refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ relates the further course of action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the further transit of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for more reinforced solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria also introduces new controls at its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ anlagen GmbH is officially completed .
the publicly listed IT Group S &amp; T is set in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment .
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er .
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the New shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
a total of 1.7 million euros has been invested in the location by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to buy a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop compared to the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and fabrics from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ fe@@ ather bags of the Fur@@ la brand , pur@@ ses are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve wonder@@ ed for a long time if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deciding factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Linz large @-@ area who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even has Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she has put her fashion interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women turn into rap@@ tures when seeing a hand@@ bag , the professional woman cannot answer with the last security .
perhaps it &apos;s because a beautiful bag will upgrade every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ emaker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , op@@ poses journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US Pres@@ idential Office is whi@@ r@@ ling up the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cut it off well .
this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker with the hair@@ dresser &apos;s hair@@ style is a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine road .
some people in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village are related to it over -@@ ump@@ teen corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del filmed a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter fashion , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous kids , including Tr@@ ump , the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to the Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
although there is respect for the performance of the family , it also tends to argue that Tr@@ ump is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del .
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ etter &quot; - to Hoch@@ deutsch : the gi@@ ver , says it .
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland permanently failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a film launch .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to sc@@ are illegal immigrants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ em@@ akers in retirement will rather distance the American , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so lo@@ cu@@ ous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension coach Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions how many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a bit to the church organ , which is generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t want the election , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had Sa@@ gen in the USA at the time of his grandfather were like he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Films , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 children , also in the USA aw@@ akes interest .
the Upper @-@ Bavarian municipality of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ eering &quot; village . &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ en@@ nig , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ eering &quot; village may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite the attempts of N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no big shifts in the reviews for today .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was responsible for the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the host David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand@@ still seemed to play no part in Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise made an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number lag@@ ged behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today , the gap to Sunrise has closed during the last few months .
in August , Today , today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50.000 .
until now , sunrise in September has an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the Parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebec@@ ca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and struck easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17.@@ 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia woke to 5@@ 20,000 spectators on Monday evening and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour .
hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for millions of dollars that failed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secrets to be revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki possibly have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who The Bachelor is winning .
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was en@@ wrapped in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked in with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you might have accidentally given a hint on who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have settled in a ly@@ rical way why Wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you don &apos;t , who should get the last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the very first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
Sarah standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit made it clear last week that Wood &quot; could be the One . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now locked up to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when asked how to choose Wood , if not , then it was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broad@@ cast@@ ed on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ t at his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also to the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
in his press conference , Tom@@ sul@@ a strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t , which was restored in the first playing area of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it certainly wasn &apos;t the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers were hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ light 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine any worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said .
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ach@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools if there are not new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ int@@ ger .
&quot; otherwise we will get subj@@ ection in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Free Elec@@ torate &apos;s Land@@ tag fraction conven@@ es in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e until Friday .
actually quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is dominated by the Free Elec@@ torate @-@ Meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ int@@ ger .
he called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we must go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ torate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need more staff for administrative tri@@ bun@@ als responsible for asylum mo@@ vers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ os@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several German states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform federal standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bavaria pus@@ hes off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more responsive . &quot;
but the country politics in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long lasting torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe Deutsch , &quot; at 47 grammar schools , where an extension of the secondary school stage of three to four years will be tested - as a result , it will take nine years to finish school .
but that &apos;s not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want to do so .
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever desired .
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax on the jumps
the German stock market closed tight and nervous trading operations with profits over long distances .
only in the afternoon was a fir@@ mer pr@@ el@@ ude to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately transported the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upward .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2,@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ D@@ ax rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
the Euro@@ Sto@@ xx 50 as a benchmark for the Eurozone dropped by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
solid profits also earned premi@@ ums in London and Paris .
in the US , the D@@ ow Jones Sustainability Index recently noted about 1 percent in the plus .
many stock exchanges therefore expect the markets to appear on the market until after the interest rate decision in the United States and also to the large decline in fut@@ ures trading on this Friday .
in the meantime , the discussion about the loads from nuclear power has pressed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep marks at E@@ on .
according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may lack € 30 billion in provisions .
the Federal Government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
the shares of the two largest German energy companies subsequently recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.3 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon stocks rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax summit .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend .
accordingly , investors aff@@ or@@ ded little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
automotive values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were again set than in the same period of the previous year , as the trade association AC@@ EA informed the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt .
the papers presented by the Daimler and BMW car manufacturers increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen advantages were increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market , the return return on listed national securities fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the pension index Re@@ x increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the Con@@ federation Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the price of the euro dropped to 1.@@ 12@@ 62 dollars in the afternoon .
against mid@@ day the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) U.S. dollars .
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd prot@@ esting against the proposed new constitution , an official said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the District of Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i , approximately 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used by those who are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , obviously produced such a high rate of death .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces which are formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th .
when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal which has been centrally ruled for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have speed@@ ed up the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the land at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the Alte Post youth centre .
the preparations for this are underway .
it is planned to use the grounds for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for such offers , that is , the city .
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had already purchased a part of the property which is located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and can leave the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the planning for the holiday homes on the Little Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
for the first time , the investor presented plans for the project .
several star@@ ingers are still worried - they fear selling their leisure facilities
Mon@@ thly , behind closed doors , had been negotiated , gr@@ ated , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday housing estate on the Little Sea lie close to Em@@ den on the table .
the interesting , medium @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the municipal development committee of the Em@@ de Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused investors and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now .
the project has been under discussion for months , with around ten to twelve million euros of expensive projects .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ d owners , who had come to the meeting , called out the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building .
Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea and a member of the board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a giant cla@@ d that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like several other project critics that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus charges will have to come , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , what happens exactly on a hectare large area of the former hom@@ est@@ ead , is still open .
nor is there any operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable .

N@@ HC is predic@@ ting 60 percent chance for cycl@@ one south of the Cape Verde Islands

Google La@@ un@@ ches Dou@@ bling Don@@ ate Camp@@ aig@@ n to Coll@@ ect 11 Million $ for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a € 11 million donation campaign for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have over@@ stepped the European nations because they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in announc@@ ing the donation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mass@@ oud wrote a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / can be doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for overweight di@@ abe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery .
weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity surgery has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e obes@@ e having a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - stomach b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes care approximately the same in 29 .
among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease was totally dis@@ connected and 28 % in part .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in part with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood sugar level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by about 9 percent to about 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
in comparison with the Gast@@ rek@@ tom@@ ie group , the B@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight in the fifth year ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 2.1 % ) and showed rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die during 15 years compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was comfor@@ ting for people with BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is an issue that is increasingly being noticed in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ wei@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to put a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader asked to end violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing in their countries is reduced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of ing@@ es@@ tion of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
poison control centres in the US are reporting a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection products such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of income from hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer in children under the age of 12 , reporting poison control centers , rose from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink dis@@ infection products intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
YouTube videos show how juven@@ ile dis@@ infection agents drink only because of a cheap experience .
young@@ sters have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children .
san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer contains somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially for small children , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky walking around , but people let this hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry scent san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer at school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which was legal for an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the Medical Center at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlan@@ ta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah lam@@ ented her words and was not able to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had pushed her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; that was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez advised parents and teachers not to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
apart from alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women died in Ontario women following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students from the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ex@@ iles them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the twisted plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; g@@ ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to the school authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the round@@ about in the direction of the industrial area and it was too late that two preceding vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck into the rear of an audi@@ torium and pushed this vehicle into a Ford Fi@@ esta .
an injury of about 10 000 Euros was caused by the accident involved vehicles , the police said .
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer running and had to be tow@@ ed .

I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it .
the lack of title competition in Scottish football is boring - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with R@@ angers .
de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no more highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games and why ? &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what interests them .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted Cel@@ tic fighting , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with five points ahead .
Dei@@ la said , &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the same - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the player better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton careful with January transfers

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this season to integrate what you saw with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of this kind also won &apos;t win . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it rises overall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labor for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent lay above the 5.5 percent U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the National Statistics Office &apos;s figures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
the employment rate for Scotland decreased to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year ago that Scotland had made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am a witness of an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little later today , except for a late j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when it happens and I hope that it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison inj@@ ector .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
when the day approached , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and as often more applications are available than places , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I developed my own relationship in the course of the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we laugh often when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
she admitted that she &quot; could have formulated better , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do .
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement against the death penalty will help .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all the details again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die unnecessary death .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had kept back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alleg@@ ations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dro@@ op@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy .
they know that it was going on .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said .
tonight I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I &apos;m doing my best for them .
if they start thinking I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a coach .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
before M@@ oo@@ dy had told the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will appoint when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information on what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should I believe that it will be personal ?
is the R@@ V@@ L cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I am saying is letting them think about it now .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels were based on the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him saying that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ disputed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s bill , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistakenly sent mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it would have been like yesterday the whole day , which was also like that .
but it was also like that on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after a driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and afterwards driver @-@ flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray @-@ Valley highway .
the police said the driver went on without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia presented himself to the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
the cycli@@ st , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable condition .
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy kno@@ cks back against ri@@ vals because of claims about ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as the &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League fav@@ ors of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm winner in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not too good in the rings .
Bell@@ amy defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concentr@@ ating on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the review of two leading trainers in his team gave him a confident voice , because it proved that they were worried about being defeated by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always turns up - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about w@@ rest@@ ling when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year long . but in the past six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this will occur again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling soccer , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six weeks ago they probably didn &apos;t think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the match of Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a little exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team won free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin the next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit after drug delivery
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a lifel@@ ong penalty for his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and started in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was watched as he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the course of the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a potentially life @-@ like penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he declared the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of criminal charges , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 for security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under the conditions that he gave his Australian and his Serbian passport , reported to the police every day , stopping at an initial lock of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident to A5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s House Break@@ s apart
at a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left in the last minute , as the police ha@@ st@@ ened .
the accident @-@ causing driver &apos;s cab broke apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 am .
damage to the amount of 12@@ 2,000 Euros was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ st used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg embark@@ ed on the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep , logged in to an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the mess@@ y messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches that used words for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are out pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and faced the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June of last year , and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence counsel Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg fails to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , argu@@ ing that &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit , but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other outstanding cases .
he was included in the list of sexual offen@@ ders even before the date of judgment .
hau@@ lers ev@@ ade small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up outside the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were multiplied by fear of discovery and sei@@ z@@ ure of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been picked up along the Inn river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they reached the German side on foot over bridges and st@@ aves .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to federal police information , significantly more refugees met at Munich Central Station in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
around 700 people arrived in the state capital by 8 : 00 o &apos;clock , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart .
the powerful low was the foo@@ th@@ ill of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who was dra@@ gged across the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda Islands .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , it is still possible to count on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom se@@ abed with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the masses are making it : every two years , the car makers at the IAA show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , there is mainly movement among compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) in August alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
a number of new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the fall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Opel offers a start @-@ up below the biggest ri@@ vals VW Golf , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is powered by a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the Hessen also offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time .
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available in a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Kom@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA with new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault transfers the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is available only as a fifth @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan install@@ ers want to find their position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits into the brand &apos;s design line with its curved lines .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n pe@@ dest@@ al placed his hand at the front end : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and is first integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI will be presented at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court granted a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Te@@ gel judicial enforcement agency , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated into small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square metres of floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the bare foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his official liability because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied adhesive conditions against the Land of Berlin failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges took up the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and referred the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of detention for compensation are decisive , a compensation claim was given , said it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear of the legal protection of personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of law in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they then spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee in April because he was locked in a cell naked .
according to a decision of 2011 , human dignity is also a cell without separate toilet .
moreover , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had issued an in@@ decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
over the past few weeks the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
the prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to pun@@ ish@@ ments it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of young birds , 19 are to be eliminated in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even capable of accommo@@ dating a million refugees .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot;
what comes to Germany is the following overview .
according to different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of the Interior ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) flats are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all for affordable rental objects . yearly , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments fall out of the rental price relationship , and in order to apply these particularly cheap apartments , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually would have to arise and for this the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and the Federal Ministry agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institute for Employment Research ) , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany have not been systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ot@@ hardt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany , there has been a political turning point in Germany : from the ban on employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residen@@ cy obligations that limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - a majority share the views that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market faster .
lack of knowledge of German is a major obstacle to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no adequate supply of general and job @-@ related language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted by personal contact .
according to Thr@@ ot@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important for parents to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ emaker , narr@@ ator for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators rise strongly due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacities - for example by allowing more specialist schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
they are not always taught by fully trained teachers but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ables from Berlin School Administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no Bundes@@ land forbi@@ ds asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated courses - the only exception has hitherto been Berlin , inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude .
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
because refugees with a refund or a cancellation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start a study .
the latter , in principle , do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to b@@ af@@ o@@ bile .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far in order to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span is shortened to 15 months .
but this financing gap has to be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion is an important part of their identity for many .
the state should succ@@ essively clean up the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ churches right to develop a new state @-@ religions ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights also include duties .
so the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to heed religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society .
in this way , the majority society will also have to change , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism will be more pressing .
although Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade .
but it very slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U m@@ ord@@ ship series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants and stak@@ eholder groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and for which international agreements such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism Convention Germany are committed must become a reality in the coming years if the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees hitherto expected , Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding man@@ power and capacities we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all newcom@@ ers to sign up health cards right away .
services provided could be settled in the federal states later on .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to leave as many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors do above all to create language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpretation costs would have to be taken over , it demands .
but many refugees are also helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ met disabilities in refugee camps , and the young people deal with HIV .
but with the partially other illnesses , German doctors come to terms with their education , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the lack of doctors is perhaps even relief from the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have developed a highly developed educational system , several refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill following estimates of the Federal Environment Agency ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K , is particularly vulnerable .
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee boy reaches Germany traumati@@ zed .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder are suffering from so @-@ called Flas@@ h@@ backs including short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death fear .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong fri@@ ght , and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , said Mun@@ z .
to date , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive a psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ically ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , it usually takes several months to process .
in addition , in the social offices , experts or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst in the man@@ ege on the brick invites cal@@ ves to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ ners .
for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
thus , the family is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef emphasizes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst as his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cu@@ ban duo wants to loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
besides numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ag@@ ility .
balancing on a ball with the imp@@ eller ?
no problem for He Yuan .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics like little others and fascin@@ ates with its flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst took a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , it doesn &apos;t work well either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ sten , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is removed from the eyes of every wish .
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
the highest command therefore : care for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y@@ tail and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all our hearts . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks to his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening has also been asser@@ ted by alleg@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned that they were warned to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the services of the company .
HP will later split into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead unity after separation .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a wide and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that help businesses transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on delivering unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; added a statement by the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage was called the birth place of Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to handle the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure from HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US tech companies , is the latest in this sector that is based on the belief that closely focused companies provide a better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb
Wen@@ ger emphasized that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in touch with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd &apos;s investigation lists 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 lig@@ ands in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for ar@@ senal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 which list most of the vulner@@ abilities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal says an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
Ar@@ senal will start his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation inside the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it a little break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal is clear favour@@ ites to move through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the largest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , judging by the judge &apos;s scale of 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal raised the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph with his management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
it has never worked in Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , like suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them .
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with its emphasis on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun @-@ loving and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the nice thing about Friends was that this focus was turned up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold to fully explore their feelings .
as an employee of the telephone pastoral care explained to me , ... &quot; My hearing role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide really showed me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone might help people in moments of despair as well , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the backdrop of a completely re@@ designed cou@@ li@@ sse , why not take your friends to a drink at Central Per@@ k .
or even better if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from start to finish - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ low Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hits against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria meets on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G pass over to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani were on course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prince Park stadium on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who made the French champion the way , but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally getting their lead when Cav@@ ani reached a head office in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Shak@@ ht@@ ar Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start to the Swedish champion , as they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game by Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury I@@ bra@@ zi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which lasted a 2 : 2 on the weekend in his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ inian wing @-@ stor@@ mer was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ Defense before he ended up beautifully in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory that was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit the Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field bor@@ rows a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ fo@@ sten at the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes gave herself up , with some false pas@@ sports and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who was only scrat@@ ched in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill in bringing his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c converting Di Maria into a shot that was ste@@ ered by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post office ...
the second gate finally fell short after the hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er thus achieved his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the end result could be low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi won a gate at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League , which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches do not suff@@ ice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ through stock sales
the coal mining giant Gl@@ en@@ core , which is resident in Switzerland , is affected by falling commodity prices , collected € 2.5 billion on Wednesday through a stock sale as part of its huge debt settlement plan .
the Gl@@ en@@ core registered company in London said in an explanation that it sold new shares worth approximately € 1.6 billion to pay off its own debts .
the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , is struggling with declining commodity prices as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights brought a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange at the trading on the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 Index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core announced last week &apos;s $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to rep@@ ay about a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns relating to long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by around half , coal , copper and other raw material prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .

the White House confirms X@@ i J@@ in@@ p@@ ings &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirming the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and respon@@ ds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement .
the US president and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also host X@@ i and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner this evening after the two leaders have conducted bilateral talks .
&quot; President X@@ i &apos;s visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese cooperation in a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President X@@ i will give the opportunity to construc@@ tively approach areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement .
XI , whose visit was first announced in February , is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before travelling to New York City at the UN General Assembly in September .
it is expected that Obama and X@@ i address a number of conten@@ tious issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns relating to China &apos;s alleged cy@@ ber@@ crime and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea .

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , two times European champion , two times world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in front of Barcelona before the European Championship 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to have a hu@@ stle and bu@@ stle . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not switch
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is today working for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I played a great Euro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with it he got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i ?
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated victory at the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ts the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on insured . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted with s@@ worn dis@@ belief and called out &quot; Ho@@ o ! w@@ ow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian fixed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ l brothers to discuss the fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - as they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown first . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te that is beaten by her white hat@@ ch .
the producer of De@@ ar White People advoc@@ ated the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights in the film ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni pressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et deser@@ ved more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4.000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement generated nationwide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the indigenous population .
in February , the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album still matte , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said .
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation as a response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality of Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the portra@@ yal of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user guide Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition @-@ show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was part of the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first Ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge at full three seconds faster which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ aps of money . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , even though he was the first to finish the course , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great gratu@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s got any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family man .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off told me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Isaac felt the same if they had sw@@ apped the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit tig@@ ers sne@@ ak up on Minn@@ es@@ ota &apos;s T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tig@@ ers .
in the past they were once one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand at the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ m .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) hit 6 times in 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ p@@ its any game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated .
the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ piece hit since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has curved the wood , &quot; said Aus@@ sy .
he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ stage at the end of seventh inning , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double at the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second bass driver Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ flow@@ ed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run tear from the righ@@ th@@ guard Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen has brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe proposed a double play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside of the city , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed , however , chose S@@ ano with three sp@@ ells for his fifth Save .
Detroit fav@@ oured the start of the game by an even non @-@ mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been cut out of the vulner@@ ability before the game after he had been missing more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ hes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third driver Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers increased in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ Count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rel@@ ever righ@@ th@@ guard A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es three R@@ uns were hit with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the Sh@@ oul@@ der of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a distortion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin san@@ i@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to attend Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people involved in this are to be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
she calculated with 450 to 750 coming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital had been prepared for this event in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily shel@@ ved there .
they shall then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government pres@@ idency of Gie@@ ßen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he repro@@ ached the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective refusal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on site for the refugees .
Austria controlled at the southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF . no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too has sent back refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been discussions between the General Director of Public Security and the representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , the EU states have not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Tuesday , 22 September , the EU interior ministers wished to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee traffi@@ cker in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the first recording and distribution of people more strongly .
the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection would get it too . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a perspective view , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was deeply divided in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; huge effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border with Romania could also be tied up with a fence .
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ gs seeking ev@@ asive proposals about Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants have emerged in Turkey on the path to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds , En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus , a global ocean sw@@ ells .
this includes researchers from observations of the indoor son@@ ata &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
accordingly , the moon is mil@@ led easily on its orbit around the ring planets .
this tu@@ g movement is only small , but still too large for a permanent solid esti@@ al body , it is written in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state of New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
so &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes in the South Pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn .
at least on the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers then closed .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties presented a defensive stat@@ es@@ man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .

no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slim line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively large amounts of sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ gos contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor of beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t tell anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ go can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then , of course , they taste pure or sweet .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as ch@@ ic@@ cor@@ ee and radic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

first fo@@ aming tower , then striking cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn stops in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz ha@@ st@@ ened on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n sometimes blows through the fo@@ al valleys with storm strength .
after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature back .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest exposure .
on the night of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys in the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the fo@@ eh@@ n valleys until Thursday morning , partly isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i region with more than 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can penetrate into the adjacent centre of the centre in places , and on the mountains , even hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible .
while in the north on Wednesday a stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity starts to st@@ ow at the alpine clo@@ ak .
this is where rain stops , which stops until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the south of the Alps , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain can be expected per square meter , this has already fallen large rainf@@ all over the past few days .

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther place
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a nam@@ eless place was christ@@ ened on Wednesday in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ formers .
in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Protestant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in sec@@ rec@@ y for centuries as a minority .
with the square it is symbo@@ lically visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
at that time , he felt the city as a dec@@ ep@@ tive sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
according to histori@@ ans his negative impressions are likely to have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses on the trade @-@ off trade .
hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the crown of the crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt had painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who wrote in 150 subjects his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : the same applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the relevant Scriptures on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus &quot; transl@@ ates &quot; into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this gives the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter @-@ Order .
&quot; the education took place already with the cane , &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to perhaps also forgive me with the Lord . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to revi@@ ve art in a fast @-@ moving time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is today marked by publi@@ city , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is displaced there .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; I have always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but rather the themes that are important to him .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; said Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther &apos;s publishing house , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and that of responsibility .
a part of the original - paper and linen wallpaper - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
start of construction for BM@@ X rail
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model earth moun@@ ds for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track it was already finished .
failures in politics and administration caused confusion , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , and was now able to inform Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck in the children &apos;s and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen even more , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then start with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a pause .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ lig@@ a sets a clear mark on the weekend .
the soccer respon@@ ds to the intensi@@ fying situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the problems facing it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone is interested in getting a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach .
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will certainly play a central role here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
soccer can and wants to help .
but the crucial course must be politics .
the German S@@ occ@@ er League therefore expanded its Refu@@ ge@@ e Initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this programme .
already this weekend , the 36 professionals place a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) , they will contribute to the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sport chief Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of the women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 lic@@ en@@ sees had launched their own projects would be great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association together with the German Federal Government &apos;s DF@@ B and the Federal Government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP Chairman of the Board of Directors loses one eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
after the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell on a glass jar after midnight , which he worn in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner .
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully work@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will return to Germany again in October and continue to lead the software company .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up once again when you have fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as a spare driver for the two common drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just as little as one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback issued by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have definitely broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ lig@@ a in du@@ el with F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot fall back on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ lig@@ a @-@ Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
in view of the high burden of his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its position on the Re@@ us position .
in this way , he announced a change to the door @-@ keeper position .
this is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the seat of the family @-@ based Roman natur@@ ell .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el left it open for Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller to be used in all Europa League games .
with a high probability he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ mic statement by fellow players Re@@ us , that the final draw for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , holds mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance of taking the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead the way for Germany
according to the federal government &apos;s will , Germany is to be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investment in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the IAA in a &quot; new mobility age . &quot;
automated and networked driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the topic with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who come together with representatives of the industry at the IAA .
among other things , the strategy paper of the Department of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a spe@@ edy migration to digital radio .
a test track is currently being tested on the highway 9 in Bavaria to test new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany , for example , wants to use internationally that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
when automated driving , the car increasingly takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected until 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around EUR 8.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the testing organization Dek@@ ra , concluded that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it to be 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed by 20@@ 25 expect autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the US .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give up control during the entire drive on all roads .
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could envis@@ age 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
well each fourth would leave the car under no circumstances under any circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status of the title battle of September 25 to October 4 of the Düsseldorf Congress , the Düsseldorf plans to kick @-@ off only in sing@@ les .
the final decision is to be made latest on 22 September at the latest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said federal coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; explained Ein@@ zel @-@ Europ@@ am@@ ei@@ ster Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded us of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; Timo was also ste@@ aling back then , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should focus on this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven the defender was hit by a tac@@ kl@@ ing of H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after long treatment .
the first diagnosis was suggested by Bas@@ tian Schwein@@ bar@@ ber &apos;s 20 @-@ year @-@ old fellow players for a sh@@ ale .
Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights are display mannequins , which look horri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I &apos;m the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was ble@@ ached earlier , but now it &apos;s real , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
for the visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18th at the Kunsth@@ alle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work , for which much effort was practi@@ sed : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example a sty@@ list was engaged .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the Mach@@ er sent 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the October festival there was still a special treat : a leather trousers @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion studies of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy bear and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him to play .
he later taught fashion designing fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
he did not have to pay the models for his first fashion show .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ant lace as fashion niche
in the past , the long embroi@@ dery @-@ machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were created in a large quantity for customers who worked on them for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ gran@@ ites .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , and was then replaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt names several examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing supplier potential .
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make half of all orders .
in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they may wear the protected label .
around 80 percent of sales have been cut away over the past 15 years .
there is almost no more private specialty shops and wholes@@ al@@ ers .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass @-@ ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is driven out almost exclusively by chains .
in addition , export is weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the United States .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we have a seal of quality which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , we have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historical snow@@ ball tip .
at the same time , the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates little chi@@ cks in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ dry gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing mist@@ ress Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewelry .
in a complex process she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ en lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ or@@ abili@@ a .
with this I see my jewellery as modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en lace .

XI aims to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider to the outside in order to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group who was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; China should commit to attracting foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to promote new spin @-@ offs and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management group adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system .
following the statement , a negative list will be created , the sectors and companies identified not to be questioned for investment .
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
the initiative is important , as it all@@ u@@ des to the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a rule @-@ law business environment and is more open to the market , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease checks on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new cross @-@ border economic cooperation models and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
within the framework of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang G@@ oli participated in the meeting , as reported in a statement released after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ or fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ors and to help consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the tox@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of missed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force of pregnant and small children , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ors are already heavily loaded with mercury , that on the basis of the still valid limit values approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
in return for this loos@@ ening , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt .
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal which is highly toxic over the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government is therefore cau@@ tioned that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; low amounts can potentially cause damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Ministry of the Environment stated on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury runs primarily through coal combustion in the environment .
according to a written confirmation by the Federal Ministry for the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants attract more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long lasting and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March from the paper . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
