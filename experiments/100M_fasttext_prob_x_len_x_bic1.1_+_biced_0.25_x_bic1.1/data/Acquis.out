the community and the states appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appointed arbitr@@ arily elect a fifth complain@@ ant .
if the Community and the States or the Organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for an arbit@@ ration , the association or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure is to be applied if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all resolutions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention applies to non @-@ nuclear non @-@ nuclear states , the contract party of the contract and members of the association , in force , i ) if the relevant State of the Organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and
II ) if the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consul@@ ts each other on request of one of the contracting parties to am@@ end this convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States .
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the organization from any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and the States receive the written Noti@@ fication that their procedures for entry into force are completed .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures set in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of core material of peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other nuclear disper@@ sions for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a bran@@ ching through the risk of early detection .
in order to enrich the target set in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ aded with spatial intervention and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the verification tests by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity demanded for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of time , indicating the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
when performing their checks , the organization makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in applying its security measures , the Community of de Proced@@ ures and Meas@@ ures shall make use of the following kind and , as far as it is necessary , fores@@ ee , as far as necessary , in the supplementary agreements and are appropriate :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantity of preserved , produced , failed , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock volumes ;
B ) the evaluation of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for assessing the accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol - and report system which indicates the core material inventory and the changes of this stock , including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures under this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore preparation .
B ) If ur@@ anium or th@@ orium material ( which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) has not yet been reached into the states , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) relies on core material which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ al enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or is this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Agreement .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the provisions mentioned in Article 11 are not fulfilled , however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to this agreement , is temporarily not possible or desired , the organization and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community are unanim@@ ously determined that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on request of the community , the organisation will release the following core material from the security measures following this convention :
a ) Special fis@@ si@@ le material , when used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es core material which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Agreement , provided that the entire amount of the core material liberated in the States is no longer available at any time due to this Article in the States .
a ) a total of one kilogra@@ m of special p@@ alt@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is processed , processed or stored together with the core material which is subject to the security measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ use of the security measures on that material .
the association meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are required in the scope which is required for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization under this agreement , in the individual as to how the procedures defined in the Convention are to be applied .
the supple@@ mental agreements can be extended or modified without changing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the take @-@ over between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report cited in Article 62 , the Organization shall set up a consolidated stock of inventory of the entire core material underlying the securing measures of this Convention , regardless of its origin , and will continue to carry out this inventory on the basis of the following reports and the results of its review .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference for International Economic Co @-@ operation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by common resource center problems .
C ) It is the goal of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound to the entry into force within six months , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the E@@ EC submitted a table showing how to apply the criteria specified in this agreement -
the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; special transaction account , &quot; which the Member States shall contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the organization as a custo@@ dian , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is run separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debit cards of the Member State , which are payable on request in the currency of the respective State at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction and must be deposited in the place of the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) The payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the Administrator @-@ appointed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the residual value of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other date agreed between the E@@ EC and the Administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may wish to make payments in advance of the aforementioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker suggests about proportional distor@@ tions on the cash or the school reserves in order to cover the expenses for the special loan and balance the special transaction account appropriately .
under the granting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions :
( III ) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries are governed by contributions from other sources .
each special loan is the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , which is considered , approved and administered for the financing programme of the Organisation ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is to be taken into account for the purposes of the Organization financed by ordinary funds of the Organisation .
the funds of the special transaction may not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which is tied to a program or project within the framework of a loan or credit that has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from section 4 , special re@@ payment loans are subject to the same re@@ payment terms commonly applicable for the organization granting loans , so they can be re@@ payable in ten years each in 50 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special loan loans are granted in one or more currencies of the member states and are re@@ payable in these currencies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
payments for the payment of this watch must be made directly to the organization which it reserves .
any special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular .
the proceeds from any special loan can be used for expenditure in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and who could be the recipient of a special loan granted to the Administrator at the time of the loan granted .
capital re@@ payments of a special loan take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be transferred from the administrator to the respective Member State as soon as possible .
until full disclosure of all the Special Issu@@ es , the Administrator will instruc@@ t the E@@ EC on the plans and programs approved by the directors for the examination by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special loan , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
the car@@ et@@ aker transm@@ its the E@@ EC as soon as possible after the end of the fiscal year of the organization a detailed invo@@ icing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organisation to this account closure .
after full pa@@ yout of the special loan , the administrator of the E@@ EC shall deliver a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts to be financed from the accounts , the amounts paid to the account and deposits received from the account , and the re@@ funds to the Member States are apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely to achieve the goals of this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issuing of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time will give an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special actions , and all other issues concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date when the E@@ EC and the organization entered into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are due to immediate effect .
if the total amount of the special loan held by the recipients in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement is rep@@ aid and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States listed the general sec@@ ret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities to termin@@ ate the procedures in question .
the Sec@@ ret@@ ariat General direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement will be effective and will enter into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned Noti@@ fications in the Organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each word is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled core fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE nuclear community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this programme includes the creation of a large trial facility , the project JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a Joint Company after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Vent@@ a@@ JET . &quot;
for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled core fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question .
since until the practical use of the controlled core fusion is still extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research activities , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable every contracting party to draw unnecessary over@@ laps due to the pooling of its research efforts in the field of controlled core fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for the research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive electricity production by using the controlled core fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
to ensure effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss program takes over long @-@ term objectives and forms of cooperation within the Eur@@ atom application ; it is extended or modified after examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement to include new activities relevant for the Eur@@ atom application .
each time the parties are accepting a new programme , it will take the place of the programs listed in App@@ en@@ di@@ x I and II .
the association intended in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work with the Eur@@ atom Programme ;

in the context of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project JET .
in view of the implementation of the association intended in Article 2 Cl@@ ause 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those referred to between the Commission and the States or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s &quot; in view of the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of human resource exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Change . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the project JET , Switzerland belongs to the Joint company JET with the time of entry into force of the present agreement .
furthermore Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become contractual partner of any contract whose objective falls within the framework of the present agreement , excluding association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association provided in Article 2 , Section 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the association agreement .
the association agreement shall , in particular , envis@@ age the sub@@ stitution of a steering committee to the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
to monitor the development of the research work and to draw the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning the ongoing or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task with regard to all research and development activities that this agreement relates to .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and co @-@ ordination between the associated bodies and aims at its T * relevance in the interests of both parties to the common objective set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss program , as well as the common goal established in Article 1 of the present agreement , taking into account the scientific and technological developments that are emerging in the world .
according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consultancy groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking .

any contracting party may cancel this agreement at any time , subject to a six @-@ month period .
in the form of a letter to change the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the process of custom@@ izing customs tari@@ ffs in case of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , the agreement will also appear to include an article 12 to the agreement .
I be@@ g you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose you as an appointment for the entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above .
I be@@ g you to confirm the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements , the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States as part of medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could conclude stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks issue a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of EUR 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future pro@@ visioning funds of the member countries .
already now , however , we have mentioned some conditions that the BI@@ S would be willing to apply .
with each stand @-@ by loan , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without the fact that a total of five years would be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as in their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit @-@ opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made prior to the exp@@ iry of a month after the stand@@ by agreement was concluded so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draws will take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taking into account the funds of the Bank , expected to be three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to acquire the required resources on the market , then the interest rate used in the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin raised by a corresponding margin .

- frozen mamm@@ oth , lamb and goat meat ( collective Tari@@ ff 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Custom@@ s Tari@@ ff ) .
within the framework of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amounts according to the Community :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the quantity demanded does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the community claims the safeguard clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the access to the community market regulated by this agreement is not affected .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay are exceeding the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year concerned .
the community is obliged to limit exhaus@@ tion to the import of products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay changes the quantity set under number 2 in accordance with the scope of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ ech@@ est rate mentioned under number 5 will be taken into account .
the total quantity mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 5 800 tonnes of total car@@ case weight .
the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb &apos;s meat on the common market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the community meets provisions so that the sale of frozen meat from frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an she@@ ar fish due to the regulation of the regulation .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs is carried out only at prices and conditions that are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ ch and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay , in particular , guarantees adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular by the fact that , within the quantities stated in this Agreement , export lic@@ ences are granted to the products listed under the number 1 .
in turn , the Community is obliged to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , in implementing provisions , the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent body of the Community shall at regular intervals inform the amounts that the export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be en@@ coded according to the country of destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Eastern and Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this time it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement are checked by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s approval with this letter .
&quot; I honor myself to refer to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the consolidation of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the joint market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . during these negotiations , the two parties are as follows :

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended manner by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be studied to the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest serum th@@ inning in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively to the volume of the blood flow in@@ undation in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely anti @-@ D re@@ agents to determine blood group determination International standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of International units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter speci@@ fies di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series at which a micro@@ scopic ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the International standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard prepar@@ atory or a state standard prepar@@ atory in international units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) .
if you bring them to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ers contain 256 international units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard of Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date of dry re@@ agents to be issued on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight , if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the sol@@ vents delivered with the dr@@ y@@ re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic if the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents for blood group determination specific to the international exchange should not be colored arti@@ ficially as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content , where appropriate , can be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the Manufac@@ turer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all production stages and controls of re@@ agents to determine blood type determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents can be stored for a long time from the laboratory until it is prob@@ able that the batch is no longer used .
the re@@ agents used for blood type determination can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective constitu@@ ent in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
each individual container holds a black and white printed label in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ activation ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions enclosed in the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h group may be changed if international standard preparations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells that contain the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; complete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 in relation to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ percent sal@@ ine solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in these cases , an application must be subsequently submitted , in which it may be subject to a periodi@@ c collection registration with the consent of the competent authorities , within the time stipul@@ ated by these authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , you may be allowed to use commercial paper instead of a single document .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions of collecting consi@@ gn@@ ments , the competent authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the provisions for the export and the shipping procedure shall be delivered to one and the same pre@@ text by means of the copies planned for these form@@ alities .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are convinced as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the application in the individual stages of the proceedings shall coinci@@ de .
( 1 ) To ensure seamless goods traffic between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or violations , the customs authorities of these countries impose one another upon request , or - if they consider it interested in another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The Administr@@ ative Aid may be denied or denied if the sought @-@ after country of view is that the official aid would affect its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or viol@@ ate business , commercial or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the case of refusal or refusal of the official aid , the appropriate decision and its justification is in@@ ad@@ missible to the requ@@ esting country .
