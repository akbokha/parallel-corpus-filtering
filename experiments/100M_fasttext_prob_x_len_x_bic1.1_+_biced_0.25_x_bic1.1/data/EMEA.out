this document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
if you need more information about your disease or its treatment , please read the package ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Wir@@ res thought and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psychological illness in which patients have alternate periods ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal sen@@ timent .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the drug in the past .
the injection solution is used for fast control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or the enam@@ el tablets in patients who have difficulties swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dosage should be modified by Abi@@ li@@ fy .
this affects signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells to one another .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole supposedly appears as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , like 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , works to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their occurrence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies lasting up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , over twelve weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabil@@ ised with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased tur@@ mo@@ il , compared to that of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted trials to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution to take in .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than those receiving placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies .
abili@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effectively than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled shr@@ ub@@ s ) , acute symptoms ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , vomiting , nausea , nausea , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorders , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients presenting the man@@ ic episodes relating to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , out@@ weigh the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorders , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients presenting mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes relating to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
abili@@ fy abili@@ fy abili@@ fy the efficacy of abili@@ fy in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and has been reported in some cases after the start or after the replacement of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ i@@ ary and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy should be considered , consider reducing the dose or stopping the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dis@@ continued .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses that are associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treated patients .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extreme and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no exact risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination @-@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is recommended if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist F@@ AM@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid inhibit@@ or , reduces the response rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ isers , the joint application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
considering the common benefit of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after removal of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose of dosage prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected to rise with a moderate increase in Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ ite concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used during pregnancy because of insufficient data on human safety and due to the concerns caused in the reproduction studies of animals , unless the possible benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned against using dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Parkinson &apos;s , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study for over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with a hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase for over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dosing , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partially agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2 and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once a day for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ c@@ us and the put@@ file .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a half @-@ oper@@ as @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who attended the study medication were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) in week 52 .
current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions @-@ Rate @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a placebo superior efficacy in week 3 and a learning effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , who sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum reflections , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to placebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ pack , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
mean exclusion time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as well as in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia do not show gender @-@ dependent effects .
there was no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in comparison to young healthy subjects .
a single dose study in patients with different cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the function of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equ@@ ates to 3 to 10 times the average Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates found in the human g@@ all at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for more than 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partially agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study for 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio@@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) lay .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended clinical dose or 16 to 8 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the mean ste@@ ady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used for quick control of a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in people with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the resor@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy enam@@ el tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with a@@ stringent and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , conduc@@ tion disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions which pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ i@@ ary and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less , occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , alternating layers of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding the deterioration of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combination @-@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics where weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ festy@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ gregation was greater compared to the one @-@ time dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in a study where healthy subjects Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) were used intra@@ muscular as one @-@ off and who received the same time as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist F@@ AM@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid inhibit@@ or , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically irrelevant .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after removal of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose of dosage prior to the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) was intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole &apos;s sole gift .

the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - Treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study more than 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment was 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term study for more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally transi@@ ent and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects associated with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy and also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements in ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders associated with placebo and was similar to Hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 hours ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding ag@@ gi@@ ti@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the mean recovery from bas@@ eline scores on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed with regards to the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients who attended the study medication were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) in both groups .
current values from measurement scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ A@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions @-@ Scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than with hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , in significantly fewer patients an increase of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study for over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , who sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum reflections , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior to placebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ pack , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l &apos;s injection solution was tolerated well by rats and apes and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15 - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ related concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogenic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in doses or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ mentation accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ma cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was found as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , three @-@ quarters of which had previously been anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medicine containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
only patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer have no difference between the drug and the efficacy indicators such as time to deterioration of disease and survival .
on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the start of treatment .
the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it must not be given with other drugs in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy drugs to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the whole European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved on degrees of 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose changes in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies have been conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose changes in patients with kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nano @-@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which could have substantially other pharmac@@ ological features than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be removed immediately and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in the patients no renewed abra@@ sive cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has risen to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
whereas a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity was not proven in connection with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if the patients receive nausea , vomiting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane , these can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not bear a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of sperm conservation , as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were once treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was fast rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
listed in Table 1 are the side effects associated with the addition of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , flat@@ ul@@ ence , tongue burn , dry mouth , aching g@@ ums , loose stool , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in limbs , muscular weakness , very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a timi@@ atom@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the amal@@ gam@@ ation of micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules by blocking their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the micr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cellular functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ se@@ d@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 night@@ ing@@ receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation occurs in the area of the tumor because of the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two armed un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multi@@ center trial was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel all 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 than 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are stated below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy to dimin@@ ish bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical studies .
exposure to active agents ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane on patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide @-@ ranging extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arly distribution and / or weight binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ be and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data were available about patients at the age of 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was proof@@ ed at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and in front of light light for more than 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogenic agent and , as in other potentially toxic substances , caution should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane leak@@ age bottle .
after full addition of the solution , the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .

this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels where complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood donation is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make an own blood donation , ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or super@@ visor , provided they have received an appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference medicine in a case study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either switched to amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of amed ab@@ se@@ amed and those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study involving patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure that can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ ra@@ ine @-@ like headaches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or one of the other components .
ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence was provided that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals across all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to Medi@@ ce Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the need for trans@@ fusion in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ ple@@ m my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and the risk of trans@@ fusion due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the start of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; ( no iron deficiency ) if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger surgical procedures which require large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in men ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied to a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edi@@ cal procedure in adults with no iron deficiency , where a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ b 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml applied not to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and effects may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in readings can be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is needed to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low h@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with initial an@@ a@@ emia less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using IV application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and total disease ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose , which is required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ proc@@ ity number of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be retained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. per week once a week .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the reci@@ proc@@ ity number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ proc@@ ity number increased by ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the reci@@ proc@@ ity number increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be abor@@ ted .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , should be taken twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the ab@@ se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. per kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each for 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients who suffer from a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ cy@@ tin ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) in the treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin should not receive an ab@@ se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within a month before treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not part of an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ or program : severe coron@@ ary heart disease , peripheral vascular disease , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of effectiveness , defined as a decrease in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the receptor deficiency should be determined and the usual causes of failure to respond ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence toxic@@ ation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated .
if the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of effect is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy .
in clinical studies an increased risk of mortality and risk of severe cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that can be attributed to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased above the concentration required for control of the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should not exceed 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy under Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in the case of tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin response should be taken into account for the assessment of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see section 4.2 ) of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly , if possible , before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular disease , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be ruled out that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been shown to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target was targeted at 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose can be adjusted to rising hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular attacks , deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , hem@@ or@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can cause th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia .
it could be shown using the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .
3@@ 89 patients with hem@@ o@@ bla@@ sts ( 2@@ 21 multiple my@@ el@@ omes , 144 non @-@ Ho@@ d@@ g@@ kin@@ - lymph@@ omas and 24 other ha@@ em@@ bla@@ sts ) and 3@@ 32 patients with solid tumours ( 172 breast carcin@@ omas , 64 gy@@ na@@ ecological tumours , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 22 prostate carcin@@ omas , 21 gastro@@ intestinal carcin@@ omas and 30 others ) .

survival and progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to a number of frequent malign@@ ancies in a consistent , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin patients and controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately 20 times the weekly dose recommended for use at humans , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased push@@ al body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports support in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with agreement with the competent authorities of the member states , the owner of the placing of the goods has the following information and materials to provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials .
the owner of the marketing authorisation agency has to ensure that the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and is operational in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the traffic .
the owner of the Risk Management Plan ( Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , described in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , under@@ takes to carry out the Risk Management Plan described in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management System for Hum@@ use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided simultaneously with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • in receiving new information that may have influence on current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures • within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones .
• In a month before your treatment , have suffered a heart attack or stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred before you
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the cervical vessels ( vascular disease of the carot@@ enes ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets within the normal range , which can be reg@@ ressed during further treatment .
your doctor will carry out regular blood tests if necessary to check the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets on a regular basis during the first eight weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , loss of blood , vitamin B@@ 12 or fol@@ ate deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before starting treatment .
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin has been reported very rarely after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( skin @-@ spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ z@@ ema , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how best to treat your an@@ a@@ emia .
therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of problems with the heart or the blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of elevated or rising potassium levels , your doctor may take into account an un@@ interrupted treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back to normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically apparent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion sign due to inadequate cardiac output , your doctor will make sure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the efficacy of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your blood lip@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose to keep the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be very carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , particularly if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in case you are cancer patients , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed is like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances the tumor may have a negative impact .
if you have a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , you should check the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment and treat it accordingly .
if your red blood lip@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values are too high , you should not get ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ot@@ ting after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other drugs or have recently taken it , even if it is non @-@ prescription medicine .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread to two equally big inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia responds to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will conduct regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor will consider this appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed himself under the skin .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including those who recently suffered from a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as with the H@@ inf@@ low ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection into a muscle prior to the initial in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( agent against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this condition .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study almost 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered hip frac@@ tures ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , in two studies Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate for six months ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to bas@@ eline .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis em@@ edi@@ cine ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis em@@ edi@@ cine ) .
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ tures 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to zinc phosph@@ on@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions at the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta manufacturer provides information material for physicians who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued approval to the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company for Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s placing in the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg accor@@ la@@ sta once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol can be reduced by acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population .
a pre@@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the onset of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , equivalent to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be examined before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
there is no data available to patients who need dental interventions to reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s application ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious side effects reported cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , random ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which , as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases , expressed kidney failure .
the change in the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the transi@@ ent asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium assets below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were observed in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recent hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion point , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including ori@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of these reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 Study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area with a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in case of over@@ dosing , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous cal@@ ci@@ um@@ glu@@ con@@ ate intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion can be achieved .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was identified in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ oral h@@ amen ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric properties of the spine decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta had an equally lasting effect over three years which resulted in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the whole hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer @-@ tom@@ ographic ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in tra@@ be@@ cular bone volumes and the preservation of tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly by 30 % after 12 months compared to bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all times in comparison to placebo treatment .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment and 4.3 % on the skull .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated at 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the yearly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the random variation of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients and patients over the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , particularly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ times age @-@ specific upper normal value when entering the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months has been demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
in the combined results a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ hel@@ i@@ at .
patients who were classified as respon@@ dents at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be enrolled in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 patients treated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response of 141 of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ hel@@ i@@ at , was maintained for an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
thereafter , the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ = 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long period of elimination with a terminal elimination time of ½ g 146 hours .
the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above mentioned t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration versus time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearance of metabolic substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or not a direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 @-@ 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the c@@ ori@@ onic acid required .
as for severe kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in the case of studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C are the 6@@ x of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was determined by dose of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
rats showed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formi@@ ties and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed on rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the disease patho@@ gen Pa@@ get .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , bone reconstruction occurs too fast , and new bone material is set up un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus adding strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines , or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription drug .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta according to your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operation of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion into a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after the in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta case you are considering termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your nearest doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
adverse events associated with the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent after the ensu@@ ing in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs because of a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , have been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects not listed in this use information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to take Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion for two or more weeks after surgical treatment of hip frac@@ tures .
before and after acet@@ one administration , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
due to the rapid inser@@ tion of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , the maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .

A@@ COMP@@ E@@ LIA is additionally used for a diet and exercise to treat adult patients • who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and / or overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more
in addition , four studies involving more than 7@@ ,000 patients were carried out in which A@@ COMP@@ LIA was used as a suppor@@ tive agent for setting smoking in comparison to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on setting smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ LIA was difficult to assess in this area of application .
what is associated with A@@ COMP@@ E@@ LIA ? the most common adverse events of A@@ COMP@@ E@@ LIA found during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were nausea and upper respiratory tract infections .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients with su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts .
caution is recommended while using A@@ COMP@@ LIA medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or iso@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicine against fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ bo my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN

A@@ COMP@@ LIA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
even in patients who - besides obesity - do not have any identi@@ fiable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
patients or other close @-@ standing persons must be pointed out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with cardiovascular events ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

the following table ( table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and related metabolic diseases .
it was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for adverse events ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse events &lt; 1 % ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0,1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t

5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects that were not observed in clinical studies , but which occurred in animals after exposure in the human@@ ized area , were evaluated as possibly relevant for clinical application :
in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of the con@@ vul@@ sions appears to be associated with proced@@ ural stress such as dealing with animals .
Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycle disorders .
the impact of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study of rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and with lac@@ tation caused no changes in learning behavior or memory .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not indicated .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , met@@ form@@ in alone can not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ phon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level is reduced , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in triple therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos has led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that the blood sugar levels were reduced from 15 mg , 30 mg and 45@@ mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional application of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin was reduced by 0.@@ 94 % in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin , decreased the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were blur@@ red vision , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ ology ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account in the European Union .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , dom@@ ed and on one side bear the marker &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in people with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. a heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure reports , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels are to be examined .
the decision to continue the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be led to clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , which can be caused by fatty deposits and is associated with fluid retention in some cases .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred in the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple combination therapy with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or as a double @-@ combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported , or worsen@@ ing of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is not clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be taken into account .
in a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence came to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .

studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
drug interactions that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is due to the reduction of hyper@@ sul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance in pregnancy under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T asc@@ ents exceeded the three times the upper limit of the normal range even more often than under placebo , albeit less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , more frequently , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events related to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients was performed in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in patients treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study lasting over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , followed by 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to function via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome proliferation receptor @-@ activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose availability in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ franc as a mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8,0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ ity ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was not dis@@ continued with insulin despite a three @-@ month optimization phase were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients receiving only insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics for 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight , but clin@@ ically significant elevated L@@ DL cholesterol level were observed in most clinical trials compared to placebo .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids in comparison to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ges and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ ges .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both about an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized into groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
this is based on the contribution of M @-@ IV to the effectiveness of the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it could be proven that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .

after oral use of radio@@ actively lab@@ elled pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans is 5 @-@ 6 hours , and that of the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearing of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies mice , rats , dogs and monkeys conver@@ ged after repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the reduction in hyper@@ sensitivity and increased insulin resistance in the formation of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the bladder epitheli@@ um was induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ones resulted in increased frequency of col@@ onic cancer .

the calculated frac@@ ture incidence came to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated using either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ ges .
in clinical studies more than 1 year ago , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents compared to the bas@@ eline values .

Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror that indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly strong compared to another human insulin .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be taken from the packaging side ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risk of diabetes in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company for placing Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane on the European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a quick initial action together with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly through intensive insulin therapy , for example , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia symptoms and should be consul@@ ted accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( re@@ combin@@ ant DNA to insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than their previous insulin .
prior to travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times .
therefore , the doctor must take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and ask his patients to always consult the medicines they have taken from them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose , given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total working time is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed response .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

move the finished pen at least 10 times between positions 1 and 2 and down until the liquid appears uni@@ form@@ ly white and clou@@ dy .
• To reduce the risk of un@@ inten@@ tional need@@ les , never put the inner shell on the injection needle once you have taken it off .
27@@ 9 G hold the Flex@@ Pen with the injection needle upwards and tap the finger lightly against the cartridge for a couple of times , so that existing bubbles accumulate in the cartridge above .
the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards by turning the dose of the dose into the appropriate direction until the correct dose is opposite the indication of the indication .
this document is a summary of the European Public Health Department report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
the active ingredient in Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id , insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) is produced using the method of so @-@ called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 86 68 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ europ@@ a.@@ eu © E@@ MEA 2007 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged How was Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id studied ?
Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other ingredients .
in addition , acet@@ p@@ id doses may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S company to approve Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id travel across the European Union .
when two kinds of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin that is quickly acting must first be re@@ ared , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change .
prior to travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site Occ@@ a@@ sion@@ ally - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma occur at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , biscuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or glucose , given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar above 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed that a blood sugar induced by intraven@@ ously reduced blood sugar 4.@@ 4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total working time amounts to about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited , however , suggest@@ ing that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ p@@ id in concentrations of 0.@@ 05 I.@@ U. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin in the in@@ fusion fluid 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % D@@ - glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required during the patient &apos;s transition to acet@@ p@@ id , this may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change .
prior to travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to seek the advice of his physician , as such journeys may lead to insulin and meals to be used and taken at other times .

this can happen : • If you in@@ ject too much insulin • if you eat too little or leave a meal , if you do yourself more than otherwise physically
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• App@@ ly a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • tigh@@ ten the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Fig@@ ure A ) • Extra@@ ct the large outer cap of the injection needle and the internal cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • Take a couple of times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , these will accumulate up in the cartridge - While the injection needle still continues upward , turn the cartridge at a click towards the arrow ( Fig@@ ure B ) • While the injection needle still shows up , press the push button throughout ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now , from the tip of the injection needle , a drop of insulin must leave .
• Turn the connector back on the finished pen , so that the number 0 is opposite the dosing mark ( figure D ) • Check if the button is pressed completely .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves to the outside while you rotate the cap • The scale below the push@@ button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Note the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the recommended dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is at the bottom and you will feel a resistance . then remove the cap and set it up again so that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite .
make sure to press the push button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the button pressed completely until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge . you can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can &apos;t use it to set or select your dose .

let the cap of your Flex@@ Pen be always set up if it is not in use to protect it from light .
add the fle@@ x@@ Pen to the top using the injection needle and tap the finger lightly against the cartridge for a few times , so that existing bubbles accumulate in the cartridge above .
the dose can be corrected both upwards and down@@ wards by turning the dose of the dose into the appropriate direction until the dosage is indicated by the dose counter .
aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or k@@ not ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger deposits of ur@@ anium that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first treatment months ; therefore , it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking additional drugs to prevent g@@ out .
the medicine is not recommended for children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic acid ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once a day 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements a ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood of under 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhea , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a medical history known or currently present ) and / or arthritis .
if the ser@@ um acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there is no experience with children and adolescents , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this patient group .
organ transplan@@ t recipients As there are no experiences with transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or chronic heart failure , the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other resin @-@ limiting pharmaceuticals , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the course of treatment because the reduction of the serum resin table helps to mobil@@ ise ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of x@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before starting the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine cz@@ ar did not perform any interaction studies on F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( a blocking of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine metabolism was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous dose of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and n@@ apro@@ xen was 250 mg twice a day associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the application of n@@ apro@@ xen and other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
ant@@ acids It could be shown that simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and decreased the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data over a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies may not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , serving machines or exercising dangerous activities until they can be reasonably sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a num@@ eri@@ cally higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total budget review group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be observed in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rhea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical studies no severe skin r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the events related to the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups more than once and performed in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or at a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , in@@ som@@ nia , hyp@@ not@@ es@@ thesia , conspic@@ uous EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin irritation , Bur@@ si@@ tis , protein uria , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in the concentration of potassium in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te numbers , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ in @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro in@@ hibition that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX Study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in each study where the last three monthly ser@@ ene acid levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum supple@@ mentation value at the start of studies of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .

AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C reached the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage decrease of serum levels in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function ) .

the data collected in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of the patients needed a treatment against a gi@@ f ( ie more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a gi@@ ra@@ ffe ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the sever@@ ity of the g@@ out , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the g@@ out no@@ des by month 24 in 54 % of the patients .
elevated SH@@ E values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term care with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5,@@ 0 % ) and also in patients receiving al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum levels , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) by F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data showing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose needed for preventing bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( difficulty breathing ) , abor@@ ted abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) and aci@@ dic b@@ umping .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following tips are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after rising the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract other than p@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ ations , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to dis@@ miss the medicine in case of symptoms of malign@@ ant irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after symptoms that indicate es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was found , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there is no data available that indicates whether the reduction of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients that require a s@@ late surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet next morning when taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral drugs may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other drugs ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical studies along with a variety of usually prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be used during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
however , decl@@ ines of serum calcium up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups occurred with similar incidence .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at intake of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ turing incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were investigated in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average elevation of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day in relation to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at the fem@@ oral neck and 7.@@ 8 % of the tro@@ chan@@ ter .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to observe ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur @-@ neck and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption stri@@ pped to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses of between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a standardised breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective when it was taken at least 30 minutes before eating or drinking the day .
in healthy volunteers , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies in rats revealed that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distributed in tissue tissues after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly re@@ distributed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ec@@ es .
following the IV administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 71 ml / min and systemic clearing was not exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans it influences the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs through these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the percentage of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data are available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for patients with reduced kidney function , an increased cum@@ ulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

advent is given to adult patients with kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Progra@@ f / Progra@@ f are already in use in the EU , the company has presented the results from previous studies with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms and data from the published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation where the application of Adv@@ ant@@ f was compared with Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a year of treatment ( for example , examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or a re @-@ recording of di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) .
in addition , shorter other studies have been carried out on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adv@@ ant@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Progra@@ f / Progra@@ ms .
tre@@ mor ( trem@@ ors ) , headaches , nausea , vomiting , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ kal@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , adv@@ agra@@ f may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful if others ( in particular some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time as adv@@ agra@@ f as the dose or dose of the medication consumed at the same time need to be adjusted accordingly .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ s@@ ular part with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange capsule bottom with &quot; out 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is preserved .
the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of gra@@ ft rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see &quot; recommendations below &quot; )
after switching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus table mirrors should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ ant@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate night ran@@ splan@@ tation phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the advance dose can take several days before the ady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Progra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the preparation of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dose recommendation - Swit@@ ching from Progra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f M@@ ust be converted a gra@@ ft recipient of two daily dose of Progra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily dose of Adv@@ ant@@ f , this conversion has to take place in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , based on the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ f once a day , the treatment can begin with the oral initial dose recommended in ren@@ al and liver transplantation for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplantation in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to be taken once a day .
although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ f in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ectal patients , patients with transplan@@ t transplan@@ t patients received an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ kidney function does not influence the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum carot@@ ino@@ sis , a calculation of the cre@@ atine stage and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switch from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to Adv@@ ant@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is recommended ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of gra@@ ft rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ do controls .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lat@@ ti@@ um during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood pressure levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Progra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or while using substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days before the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20@@ ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually between 5 - 20 ng / ml and kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes to the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therap@@ ist@@ ant compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording of Adv@@ ant@@ f are available .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded wording of Adv@@ ant@@ f are available .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing Johannis@@ kraut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is to be avoided during a treatment with adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a hyper@@ tro@@ phy known as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Progra@@ f , which can therefore also occur under an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disturbances are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus seem to show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and vision disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ ant@@ f Hart@@ capsules , Ret@@ ar@@ ert , L@@ act@@ ose Inclu@@ des , patients with rare heredi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are particularly careful .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and consequently increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain even concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole , and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole and with the Macro@@ eyel@@ id antibiotic Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly d@@ osed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other drugs tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with drugs that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone level , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially lower the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients do not show that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , there is an increased risk of adverse events relative to the course and outcome of pregnancy compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants .
in uter@@ o exposure , monitoring of the new@@ born to possible adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) is recommended .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ alkal@@ ine new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a large number of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) .

cases of BK @-@ Virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tumours in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high bond of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ os genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patient @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atitis and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t were used as a primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral Progra@@ f correspon@@ ded to observations in the major studies in which Progra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ centre study with oral Progra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported , who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0,@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was increased after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly lower .
a multi@@ center study with oral Progra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation at the same time , who received a random@@ ised procedure tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0,2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for reaching the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
on 155 patients ( 65 only gut , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) , the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral program showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist d@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which lead to seb@@ ac@@ eous radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as a low hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism induced by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ances observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly done via the bile .
in stable patients ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than in Progra@@ f .
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lat@@ ti@@ um during the first two weeks following transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital heart disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
dosage and frequency of use depend on whether it is used to treat ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges or to prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots like bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but produced according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that it em@@ powers the formation of the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II .
Adv@@ ate is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is made otherwise , so that the drug does not contain any proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies involving patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study of 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures has been studied .
in the main study , the effectiveness of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ ato@@ cytes with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or one of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to promote the placing of lawyers in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy are based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the place and extent of bleeding and the patient &apos;s clinical condition .
in the case of subsequent hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , Factor VI@@ II activity in the appropriate period shall not fall below the given plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until pain and acute depression are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , an appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma levels is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not ruled by a proper dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II @-@ therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the rate of administration should be based on the patient &apos;s condition whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of people with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the magnitude of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 expos@@ ures is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ posi@@ tional days and am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ory development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s encountered in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which had a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decline of the VI@@ II @-@ mirror co@@ agulation factor occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror in the plasma as well as the clearing rate showed again sufficient values on the 15th post@@ oper@@ atively day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concent@@ rates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed low inhibit@@ ors ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 ex@@ positions .
in addition , no F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II concent@@ rates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) patients treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were treated with inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of the patients to trace contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analysed by investigating antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and reported side effects .
a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a sustained peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms pointing to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ us gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported about hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 shown below .

each single pack consists of a bottle with a powder , a glass bottle containing 5 ml of sol@@ vents ( both glass type I with chlor@@ ob@@ ut@@ yl rubber stop@@ pers ) and a device for re@@ constitution ( BA@@ X@@ J@@ EC@@ T II ) .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP continues to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E security profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company accepts its application for approval of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has genetically modified so that it can carry a gene in the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and thus no infection in humans can trigger .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tumors and thus enable cancer cells to re@@ construct the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defects in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient where Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the abdominal area , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had checked the company &apos;s answers to the questions he had asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP there was not enough evidence that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours is beneficial to patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company does not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed active release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are put together in such a way that one of the effective components is immediately released and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nose caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are rejected .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main measurements were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the start of treatment and 15 days of treatment .
during the trial , patients carried their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale , how severe the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who took an a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients with a@@ ero @-@ ze showed allevi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or one of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart or vascular disease including hypertension ( high blood pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or an ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company SP Europe a permit to transport aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it must be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without cutting , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms finish .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive which can be attributed to per@@ oral or nas@@ al as abnormal Rhin@@ eland ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be terminated in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache ) .
patients with hyper@@ ton@@ ia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hy@@ dati@@ d ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or can be reduced to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole was administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies revealed however no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , it should not be used in pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in drow@@ sin@@ ess which may result in impairment of traffic and ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal processes .
headaches , anxiety , anxiety , muscular weakness , increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vomiting , pre@@ operative pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is most likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive agent P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ groups defined by gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study of the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be detected within 30 minutes after the plasma is administered .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was achieved by day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study conducted with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
Pharma co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to reli@@ eving allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely was reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or rash .
cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleeping disorders , muscular pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for inser@@ ting ( soluble tablets ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children at the age of one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between the ages of 6 and 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( itch , number and size of the square , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e , and the enam@@ el tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving placebo .
in the two trials at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the average scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % were compared to 40 and 33 % compared to the placebo @-@ treated patients .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of A@@ eri@@ us in the European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness and can be resum@@ ed after the onset of the symptoms and resum@@ ed during their re@@ occurrence .
in the case of persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets that were administered in addition to ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in drow@@ sin@@ ess which may result in impairment of traffic and ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more often than in placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were administered .
this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesive agent P @-@ sel@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses that were administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
for a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall live scores of the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , irrespective of the ae@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and that chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily and pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ al factor in all the causes of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is expected that in addition to the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , also in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , the symptoms are improved ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improvement of the disease by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study where patients were similar to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in @-@ vi@@ vo , not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( gre@@ asy , calorie rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers to humans .

ap@@ eri@@ us can be taken separately from meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabol@@ ised by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher exposure levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are drastically met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains su@@ cro@@ se and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients should not use this drug with heredi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ cro@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies did not affect psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not result in increased drow@@ sin@@ ess or increased drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , tears of tears and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the basis of the overall score of the quality of life of Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of this restriction met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are drastically met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the burden ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient accumulation after daily use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , the O@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of di@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely excluded .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ las@@ es with child safe polypropylene inter@@ connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was tolerated well ; clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data were documented .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial with multiple doses used in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo at the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. a day .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flight performance , including the reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .

immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablets must be removed without damaging them .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed food tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not significantly devi@@ ate from the safety profile identified in adult patients .

the A@@ eri@@ us solution is indicated for children between the ages of 1 and 11 , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution is attached to ing@@ ress application for use with sc@@ aling , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution .
regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s under which you suffer and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , in children under 2 years of diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia , frequent side effects during adult fatigue , dry mouth and headache often were reported as placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for inser@@ tion is available in bottles with child @-@ safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe for preparing with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially notified the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company reg@@ ains its application for authorisation of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov &apos;s placing on the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect influenza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect from a stem of the flu virus which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have not yet established immunity ( no protection ) .
after the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognizes the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; foreign @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce faster antibodies in contact with a flu virus of this tribe .
subsequently , the membrane man@@ ure of the virus was puri@@ fied , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as foreign bodies ) .
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the size of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was insufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendation , please read the scientific discussion ( also included in the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ phy@@ sis should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drugs used by the patient before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being responded to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral drugs .
in children between the ages of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is based on body weight .
as@@ phy@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood while taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thereby also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the viral load change after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only responded very few to treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the treatment with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r lowered the viral load following 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV that were resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decrease in the viral load together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r after four weeks than in patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of as@@ gen@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vomiting , rash and fatigue syndrome ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
aci@@ ase can also not be used in patients who take St. John &apos;s Wort ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicinal products , which are broken down as well as as@@ phy@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other drugs against HIV , patients who are taking A@@ gener@@ ase are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ag@@ oni@@ asis in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors out@@ weigh HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ ec@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of ag@@ oni@@ asis in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit to transport ag@@ it@@ ase across the European Union .
aci@@ ase is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and up .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should be carried out taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , ap@@ ex @-@ capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram of base are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the enhancing addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of aci@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children .
ast@@ o@@ sta@@ sis is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction at 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver dysfunction should be reduced to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application is to be done with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
aci@@ ase may not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic l@@ ati@@ tude and also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing Johannis@@ kraut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that ap@@ ex or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ ex does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an early ad@@ minist@@ ering of A@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with an am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for the symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl glass content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this form of dosage is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 times if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses associated with medications that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including ha@@ em@@ ato@@ sis and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response may develop in asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic wide ap@@ ex can not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic l@@ ati@@ tude and also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ ion enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medication whose active ingredients are metabol@@ ised predominantly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for increased plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ at@@ virus levels and , if possible , to check the viral load and dep@@ ose the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ ly avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic scheme .
52 % lower if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was undertaken to use as@@ phy@@ sis in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the attached component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and ag@@ ain@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is necessary in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs are to be used at the same time , caution is recommended since Del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended , a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous addition of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin leads to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ phy@@ sis , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day led to an increase in C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2,@@ 69@@ times compared to the value observed once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions when used together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ap@@ ex .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ phy@@ ase since it can cause resor@@ ption problems .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme reduc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r may result in degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ th@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
con@@ current intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in test subjects , the fluid cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to increase the plasma levels while ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to my@@ opathy including a hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror because the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while using am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used together with an oral m@@ yo@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for the symptoms of op@@ ium , especially if also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to adapt the am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example , Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while using A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the further development of pro@@ gen@@ y including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ phy@@ sis was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral agents .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely lead to treatment .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time as HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as related to the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and chronic sub@@ cut@@ aneous fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated individuals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over an average duration of 36 weeks was only observed one case ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 patients were treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 cases , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moder@@ ately severe , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ant nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response may develop in asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ating an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those who received dor@@ man@@ t with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with currently approved f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .

the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32 I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M / F / M
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern produces a certain cross resistance against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) appear .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ory isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failure therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study where PI pre @-@ treated adults in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard of care ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) were vacc@@ inated with an PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose p@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred thre@@ es@@ core and sixty ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gen@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis assessed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from bas@@ eline value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ discharge threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ ble@@ ached as@@ phy@@ sis is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , 152 of whom were treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered along with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline .
19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ phy@@ sis should be considered when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children .
after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r amounts to about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 8 % increase , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration at the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was un@@ affected by food intake , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , is likely to remain unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall concentrations in the st@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with care if they are given at the same time as a@@ generic ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of as@@ gen@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules , hence the aci@@ ase solution and aci@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ base .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regi@@ mens lead to pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained twice a day after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in doses of 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
in clinical studies , no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither in the administration of ap@@ ex nor after the end of the treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus g@@ ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If aci@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of aci@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application is to be treated with caution in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
as@@ phy@@ sis should be set to 27 in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a tight monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is recommended , a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be done as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ phy@@ sis , a reduction of the dose of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data are available .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ th@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ modi@@ pine , ni@@ isol@@ di@@ pine and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice daily with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in test subjects , the fluid cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % interval of 82 to 89 % ) .
combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of de@@ bil@@ itating or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a 22 % decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful balancing of the potential benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ phy@@ sis was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral agents .
in case of over@@ dosing , the patient is able to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ory isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; as@@ phy@@ sis should be considered when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active ingredients fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall concentrations in the st@@ ady state over the area of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with care if they are given at the same time as a@@ generic ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney function should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r of mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas were observed in male animals , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after two daily doses of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic use .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ations tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes were neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
toxic@@ ity studies that were treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism routes are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and up .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was neither covered in PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ in is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , ap@@ ex @-@ capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram of base are not ex@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to take away ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dosage recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ col@@ esis , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in pregnant women , pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of this drug and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z .
patients should be advised that ap@@ ex or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with ap@@ ex does not prevent the risk of 47 of the transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring the International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including ha@@ em@@ ato@@ sis and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increase , while C@@ MA@@ x is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
con@@ current intake of A@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . according to the potential toxic reaction of the fet@@ us on the contained propylene gly@@ co@@ l cannot be used during pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk lac@@ t@@ ating rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ phy@@ sis was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral agents .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time as HIV treatment , or if they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with currently approved f@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ oo@@ st@@ erten treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be considered when optimi@@ zing the therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the frequency of application and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied five times per week for six weeks . • In case of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses , it is performed three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment , with four weeks breaks between treatment cycles .
before bed@@ time the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active agent ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either daily or five times weekly .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of tumors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with placebo showed a total healing rate of 66 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ kerat@@ otic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic kerat@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or scal@@ p of immuno@@ competent adults if the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
open Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible con@@ genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or perio@@ don@@ tal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see Section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow up examination of 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated lesi@@ ons were completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream is applied in a thin layer and applied to the clean@@ sed skin area in the clean@@ sed areas until the cream is fully re@@ trac@@ ted .
these patients should be weighed between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should be weighed between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host@@ - reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with a k@@ not leading to circumcision .
when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher doses than recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations have also been observed , which have necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions oc@@ cured at the output of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and perio@@ don@@ tal area , no clinical experience has yet been found .
although limited data indicates an increased rate of sensitivity reactions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown lower effectiveness in this patient group regarding the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not investigated .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions are reg@@ ressed after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is required due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is available , therefore the application is not recommended for previously treated tumours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id .
very limited data are available on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the efficacy in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually decrease in the course of the therapy or go back after the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort to the patient or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 active lesi@@ ons reported a lower healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons .
due to the immune stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although neither once nor after several times of topical application , quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation can be applied during the lac@@ tation period .
the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) .
among the most commonly reported and likely or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ Cream in the related side effects include complaints at the site of application with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , most likely or possibly associated side effect with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in these studies was a response to the site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis are listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan shows that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine are often associated with local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / graduated ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this according to the test plan assessed the clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in severe Er@@ y@@ issues ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe ap@@ hor@@ esis and c@@ aking ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental one @-@ off oral intake of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , existed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected following the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy in the full healing of the genital war@@ ts during an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment was significantly superior .
in 60 % of all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine , the patients were completely healed ; this was the case at 20 % of the patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine compared to 5 % of 161 male patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tumors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic lesi@@ ons within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external genital war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses and super@@ fici@@ al- bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not generally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed in the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and weighed 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and in the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
systemic exposure data showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ fici@@ ency bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased mil@@ eage . a study of the der@@ mal application , which was conducted for four months , yiel@@ ded no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumors at the application point .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk to humans is considered to be very low due to systemic exposure .
the tumors appeared in the group of mice treated with the free cream , formerly and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people , even if they have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects can significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● ti@@ lt war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) , which have formed on the skin in the area of the gen@@ itals ( genital organs ) and anus ( anus ) , is a common , slowly growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spreading to other parts of the body .
if left untreated , it can result in distor@@ tions , especially in the face - for this reason , early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses are rough areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to exposure to sunlight during their lifetime .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied to flat ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or the virus responsible for the infection with genital war@@ ts .
O If you have used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before starting with the treatment . o In@@ form your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream until the area to be treated after a previous medication or surgical treatment is cured .
if there are reactions in the treated area , which prepare you severe discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
as soon as the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o inform your doctor if they don &apos;t have a normal blood pattern
if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , swelling , fer@@ til@@ isation of the skin or difficulty can be expected when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin .
do not use Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( uter@@ ine cervi@@ x ) or within the anus ( anus ) .
taking other medications may have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have intercourse with genital war@@ ts in the genital area during the infection , treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be performed .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently applied even if it is not a prescription drug .
breast@@ feeding your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream is not known as it is not known if i@@ od@@ qu@@ im@@ od takes over into breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of genital war@@ ts , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the ti@@ lt war@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully dra@@ fted .
men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 ) What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; ) .
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
for 6 weeks a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream can be applied for 5 days a week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .
very common side effects ( expected in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) Common side effects ( expected in less than 1 out of 100 patients ) common side effects ( in less than 1 out of 1,000 patients ) Very rare side effects ( expected in less than 1 out of 10,000 patients )

if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue using the cream , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more vulnerable to infection ; it can cause you to develop a blue stain faster , or it can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment is stopped .
occasionally , some patients notice changes in the place of application ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , sc@@ ab@@ bing , skin destruction , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally , some patients suffer from changes in the site ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , slight s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , irritation or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , con@@ ges@@ tion , swelling of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , throat , facial swelling , ul@@ cer , body aches , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alizing equipment , and patients may need drugs before the administration to prevent allergic reaction .

the study focused primarily on the safety of the drug , but it also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect with regard to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headaches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
frequent side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
every year , the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will check all new information that may be known , and where necessary to update this summary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me manufactures patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to the in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for placing Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a physician who possesses experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient toler@@ ates this every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions defined as any side effect associated with in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an adequate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alizing facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients are Ig@@ G antibodies to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience regarding re @-@ recording the treatment after a long break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions following an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ rot@@ ors ) to be treated to minimize the potential incidence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ing with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants less than 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their extension with a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ induced shar@@ ehol@@ ding in the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing down@@ time and ob@@ verse ede@@ ma ( see Section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form and a duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg IV every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
most patients received a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months from the start of the treatment , with a more severe progression in the patient at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature exit from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were not present in 13 / 45 patients due to radio@@ immuno@@ glob@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never come to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version .
patients with absence of up to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ des a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was observed .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro , which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning behind enzyme therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the Acc@@ um@@ ulated Sub@@ str@@ ats and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and taken up by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ Â &quot; 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were investigated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study covering the entire spectrum of the disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to be treated in the following table .
an open extension study showed improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung capacity increased further proportion@@ ately to the body size of growing children .
out of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ ul@@ eg@@ aly in front of treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study a normal liver size .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into account the clin@@ ically significant changes across five modes of efficacy ( expected pro@@ cent@@ u@@ ales normal FE@@ V , range in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year @-@ wide open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks because of increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a size increase ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the mean follow @-@ up ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up had a normal mental development speed whereas in older patients with severe hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge @-@ form only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies of pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg IV every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing scheme with 200 E / kg IV intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an alternative alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less severely affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicine against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole treatment for patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regi@@ mens .
to reduce side effects , patients should take cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic &quot; ( drug against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the addition of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood flow changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , dropped or the dose can be reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ ed the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form proceeds more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer term in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was studied in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared to the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) .
A@@ mi@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months for the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to doc@@ et@@ axel compared to 7.@@ 9 months .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. a permit to transport A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with mild , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , excluding large plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue during the whole treatment duration as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need to receive intra@@ muscular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g. ) a week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ ine tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose test must take place taking into account the presence of the Na@@ di@@ rs of the hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous treatment cycles .
after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop non@@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient loses its value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or so@@ - continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with 65 years of age or over the age of 65 compared to those aged 65 years there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to inadequate safety and efficacy data .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with liver dysfunction of &gt; 1.5 times the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - B@@ order and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ osis of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with regard to the bone mar@@ row and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ rophi@@ lic count again has a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment courses ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non@@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had occurred .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed have to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic action to reduce treatment @-@ conditioned toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min . 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space should undergo a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment .
5 cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed if this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment tin to seek advice on sperm conservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ation with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore recommended if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min . 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if it is essential and after careful balancing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) .
given the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the start of treatment to seek advice on the closure of sperm .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed passes into the breast milk and unwanted effects on breast @-@ fed infants cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the incidence and sever@@ ity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that exer@@ ts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ li@@ lac@@ tic metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed works as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ mo@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - my@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ - and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication ( random@@ ized and treated ) in the treatment arm .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural cancer was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the all@@ together C@@ is@@ tro@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival time of 8.@@ 3 months with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months with doc@@ et@@ axel treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect on overall survival was assessed in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0,@@ 0@@ 47 ) in the benefit of doc@@ et@@ axel ( n = 172 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 30.@@ 6 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination Gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSCLC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in line with hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = defined interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ prem@@ acy , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non@@ stop limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required fewer trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transfers ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
furthermore , the patients also required the gift of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as a mono@@ therapeutic agent have been studied in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumors in doses from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion regions over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the dose is recovered in the urine within 24 hours after the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs which received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , retinal changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ fer@@ ous epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with a low @-@ calorie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot drain some fats in the food , resulting in a quarter of the fats that have been supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 were compared to placebo .
in the two studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
the study with all@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for patients with relevant weight loss .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ cco , stu@@ n pull , o@@ ily / o@@ ily fa@@ ec@@ es , o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it may not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduction diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly patients and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or a fat diet .
since weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a treatment with all@@ i because the dose of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic drug has to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as drugs for high blood pressure or higher cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this medicine has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) may be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta carot@@ ene , remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamins ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a one @-@ time A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one dose , a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received an or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal and related to the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug because the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
the frequency of known side effects observed after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some size .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days in normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of possible systemic effects deri@@ ves from the li@@ pass@@ able properties of or@@ list@@ at .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ i and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ical , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the mean change in total chol@@ esterin came with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline score 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in L@@ DL cholesterol came with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at was 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites were identified in a study involving obes@@ e patients , i.e. M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l @-@ leu@@ cin group ) , which represented almost 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional safety har@@ mac@@ ology studies , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogenic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any special danger to humans .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used in overweight adults aged 18 and over with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low @-@ calorie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your height or overweight .
even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should ask your doctor for a check up .
for each 2 kg body weight , which you lose as part of a diet , you can lose an additional kilogra@@ m with the help of all@@ i .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription drug .

ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking all@@ i and if you are taking drugs for high blood pressure , as you may need to adjust the dosage . • If you have too high cholesterol , you may need to adjust the dosage .
for further useful information on the blue pages in section 6 , learn how to set your calorie goals and fatty areas .
if you om@@ it a meal or a meal does not contain any fat , do not take any capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk nutritional supplements ( see paragraph 4 ) .
to get used to your new eating habits , start with a calorie and fat @-@ reduction diet already before the first intake of capsules .
nutrition di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits .
to safely reach your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• You eat o@@ ily to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor in advance if you are not accustomed to physical activity . • Sta@@ y while taking and also after taking all@@ i physically active .
• If you cannot find any reduction in weight after 12 weeks of use by all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
in some circumstances you must stop taking all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet just at short notice and then returning to the old habits .

the most common side effects are related to the effects of the capsules , resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , since at this time you might not have consistently reduced the amount of fat in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize dietary factors : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood of you to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a nutri@@ tious dessert , as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these accompanying symptoms occur learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not store it any longer after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • Blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • Stro@@ ke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious illness and has a positive impact on your health .
select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find on food packaging . • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should take up to maximum per day .
keep in mind the tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should consume with each meal .
the amount of calories you use for you can be found below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s function , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle that amount of fat .
by maintaining the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ise weight and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related side effects .
34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to lose weight gradually and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without creating fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ oric intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can walk up steps , work in the garden or do other physical activities daily . • &quot; Medium Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , for example 3 km walking , 30 to 45 minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss it is necessary to set realistic calorie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sym@@ bo@@ lic is a nutrition journal with information on calorie and fat content of your meals .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed calories and fat and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type of weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended because there is insufficient information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents binding a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies , Alo@@ is studied in 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting .
in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ is showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ ha ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd to promote the marketing of Alo@@ is across the European Union .
ma@@ xi is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moder@@ ately eto@@ genic chemotherapy based on cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ is for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable when taking pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with whom the Q@@ t interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
apart from a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ is should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chemotherapy drugs investigated ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous dose pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ cent@@ ration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , C@@ im@@ eti@@ dine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
in clinical studies the most frequent side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which could at least be related to Alo@@ is , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there appeared similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effect relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy in case of an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 doc@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bi@@ cin and 250 m@@ g. of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ value for 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
following the findings of pre @-@ clinical examinations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of IV pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are usually dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations indicate that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to the value measured after a one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effects on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the iso@@ des C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
cul@@ mination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found in the urine within 144 hours , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active agent made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection in healthy patients the total body of the body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures that are considered adequate over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ lication and can pro@@ long the potential of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose was equivalent to the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given every day for two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ is is determined in humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for the human being .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the failure of approval for the placing of the medicine for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug effective ingredient already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue causes damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are elevated in the blood @-@ norm .
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates these for the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the efficacy of the reference medicine .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no evidence of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the active substance and the drug to be marketed are not sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference doctor ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medication triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection accompanied by crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections which have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ t resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ ma may not work against this kind of infection .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cancelled at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo responded to treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together in skin wounds , about 90 % of patients from both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( tissue filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably by MR@@ SA , it is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the site .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of al@@ tar@@ go out@@ weigh the risks of short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ aries , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. a permit for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in case of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ina o@@ int@@ ment the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started .
retina should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) in clinical studies was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ol and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations achieved in humans after topical application on abra@@ ded skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ia AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment increased from healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / ended or the therapy with al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , balancing the benefits of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most commonly reported side effect was irritation at the place of administration , which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic Deri@@ v@@ ate of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ ac@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ ac@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , blocking some P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least seem question@@ able at least some infection forms due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , consultation with experts should be sought .
no differences were observed in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ae compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ination Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ rub@@ bing skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ina sage twice daily for 5 days of topical treatment of secondary , trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was done on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and for the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of the human being after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ew@@ ed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ia IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , less participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were indications of adaptive functioning of the liver and thy@@ roid gland .
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of reduced fertility in oral dosing of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has been achieved to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure in humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ew@@ ed skin :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ ence is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ambi@@ ence is used as part of a two @-@ dose plan to protect hepatitis B only after the second dose is administered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , Ambi@@ ence may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and that the two doses of the vaccine can be put to an end .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ ence or another hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines function by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it .
Ambi@@ ence contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 and the vaccine approved since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within a three @-@ dose plan .
because Ambi@@ ence and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults are also used as evidence for the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix initiated between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ence &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six and a 12 month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ ence ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ing ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ ence may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ ence consists of two doses of vaccine , with the first dose taken at the date of choice and the second dose taken between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a chim@@ e is desired for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti @-@ hepatitis B antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination need a re@@ fres@@ her vaccine as protection , since they may also be protected by the immun@@ ological memory of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard vaccine is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after pri@@ mer@@ isation , so that the administration of further doses of vacc@@ ines may be required in these cases .
because intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , Ambi@@ ence can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally , as in these cases it can lead to bleeding after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ ence was given in the second year in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mask m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier Thi@@ glomer@@ ate and preserv@@ ative formulation .
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ ence &apos;s toler@@ ability was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ edness on a basis of the calculation for each vacc@@ ination dose of Ambi@@ ence , but not based on a calculation basis per person .
pain was observed after receiving Ambi@@ ence at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the full vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ ence had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ edness was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. across the entire vaccine cycle in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ ence , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and mat@@ ing was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ence a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ as with Ambi@@ ence or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the serum rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4,@@ 2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans of Ambi@@ ence and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ation@@ ary vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ ence hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the addition of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the responses received in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the end of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines either received a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ ence or a 3 @-@ dose ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be proven over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ ence in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that , which after ino@@ cul@@ ation of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ te A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was detected in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ ence in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and 8 ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ opo@@ ei@@ c and serum conver@@ sions similar to previous form@@ ulations .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ c@@ itation of any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
pursuant to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state char@@ itable sharing is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through vir@@ us@@ sic foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in water contaminated by sewage .
they can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ ence cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete series of vacc@@ ines has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B prior to the administration of both vacc@@ ination cans , ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ ence or any component of this vaccine including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction may manifest through it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual treatment of the second vacc@@ ination dosage ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ ence .
instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ ence is inj@@ ected into persons suffering from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ ence can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to the vacc@@ ination cannot be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction is to the vacc@@ ination .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she / she /
however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given to Ambi@@ ence at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ ence is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
traditionally , Ambi@@ ence is not given pregnant or lac@@ t@@ ating women , unless it is urgently necessary to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ ence Please inform your doctor if your child has shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 le@@ aked doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the spot or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headaches • lack of appetite
sho@@ cks frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 rot@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • drow@@ sin@@ ess • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that were reported very rarely days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 reported doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended r@@ ashes which can be it@@ chy or bubble @-@ shaped , swelling of the eyes and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden loss of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like complaints , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , abuse such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ run , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement ability of some body parts , severe headaches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions

23 In@@ form your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice any side effects not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ ence is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has been known since the issu@@ ance of the initial permit for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP assumed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ence remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ ence was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug are limited due to low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ sa@@ c can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with incomplete enzyme deficiency or hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ia is - split by several single cans to meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ sa@@ c could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) ( a placebo ) .
Am@@ mon@@ sa@@ c can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acidity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste version , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ ts effectively prevented ammon@@ ia levels in patients suffering from the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ia levels .
Am@@ mon@@ sa@@ c was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as only limited information about this drug was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval .
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme shortage has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for the use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy consists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans @-@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk of the formation of o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately reach the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium bi@@ fur@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
as metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate over the liver and kidneys is carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal reproduction and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a decreased number of functioning nerve lesi@@ ons in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred and at 78 % of these adverse events it was assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate disease , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ used , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga during the first year of life .
by means of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen release ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post part@@ um ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and who were treated with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival , but even in these patients it was time for many people with mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans @-@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a prot@@ ein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in the liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , where phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine arises .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with cir@@ rho@@ sis of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma was det@@ ectable in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium poly@@ but@@ yl board ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher on the third day than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no indic@@ ative effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets yet , or have given patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al son@@ ar .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thin@@ trans @-@ carb@@ am@@ y@@ las@@ e .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ tur@@ tles were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , lesi@@ ons occurred in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ectal patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate disease , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate recorded for each gram is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium poly@@ but@@ yl board .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water prior to use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium poly@@ but@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription drug .
during the lac@@ tation period , you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , im@@ itation of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor immediately or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of an appropriate treatment .
if you have forgotten taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c th@@ ist@@ le ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al tube ( tube that is fed through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 . remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife bridge over the top edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stress &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in the electro@@ cardi@@ ogra@@ m or EC@@ G ) .
if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ x@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or one of the other components .
it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as with people suffering from high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack .
the Committee for Medi@@ c@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or early intervention .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous addition of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is performed in another sequence , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
a bolt load of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately prior to the procedure followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a direct subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ some kind of Bol@@ us gift from Angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt load of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be made .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed before the application and the bolt dosage is quickly given intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with moderate kidney function ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second intake of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose can be checked again .
in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney damage , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT was 5 minutes after administration of the Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din Bol@@ us without a dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox may be initiated 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• Super@@ inten@@ tional hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a dis@@ ruption of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and with di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of the bleeding of arter@@ ial points occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can perform ble@@ ed@@ ings throughout the procedure .
in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and being treated with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Nor@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din again reaches the existing level before the treatment .
starting from the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te Gener@@ ations ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bio @-@ vali@@ d@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ations or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be monitored regularly in any case .
animal experiments are insufficient regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ en@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the biop@@ sy group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over the age of 65 were more prone to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i scales for heavy bleeding as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings performed significantly less than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY severely bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point of point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding lo@@ oses that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; points of point , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information about side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing PCI .
both in the biop@@ sy group and in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women as well as patients over the age of 65 were more prone to un@@ desirable events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings performed significantly less than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice following extensive use and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din can be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to both the cataly@@ tic centre and the an@@ ion @-@ bladder region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is present in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , on its part , slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active center of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ ine .
moreover , a blood th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oses syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) in the past could not indu@@ ce th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes @-@ aggreg@@ ating reaction in the past with serum from patients in which it had occurred in the past to he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ oses / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ mb@@ oses syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was found following a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary ar@@ yn@@ ge@@ al syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent fluor@@ esc@@ ein angi@@ ography in 72 hours .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from 6 years with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs slightly from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and shorter acting time than a short @-@ acting insulin @-@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in people with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot operate insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ ec@@ onds .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0,@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other drugs that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the placing of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
due to the reduced glu@@ con@@ e@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin availability , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change of the active force , the brand ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in insulin needs .
3 inadequate dosing or termination of a treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
switching from a patient to another insulin type or insulin should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment plan .
substances which can increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the influence of sympath@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserve pin .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between the In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is over@@ comes into human breast milk , but generally insulin does not exceed the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application .
listed below are the un@@ desirable compounds listed in clinical studies , group@@ ed by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing incidence of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
cold @-@ sweat , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual creation or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog @-@ ger , changes of vision , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Will be missed to continuously change the injection area within the injection area , resulting in li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous injection of glucose by a doctor .
after glu@@ cos@@ amine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) and in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin ul@@ is@@ in the action occurs faster and the working time is shorter than with a hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin ul@@ is@@ in showed a proportional glucose @-@ lowering effect in therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a lower proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ es@@ lowering effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response to normal human insulin and achieves full glu@@ cos@@ es@@ lowering effect about 2 hours earlier than acting insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , like with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
after eating insulin in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with a human normal insulin that was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ di nu@@ ds before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before starting the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
